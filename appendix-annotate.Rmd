# Annotating openair plots 

A frequently asked question  about [openair]{.pkg} and requested feature is
how to annotate plots. While all [openair]{.pkg} functions could have options
to allow annotations to be made, this would make the functions
cumbersome and reduce flexibility. Nevertheless, it is useful to be
able to annotate plots in lots of different ways. Fortunately there
are existing functions in packages such as [lattice]{.pkg} and
[latticeExtra]{.pkg} that allow for plots to be updated. An example of
the sorts of annotation that are possible is shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:timePlotAnnotate), which is an enhanced version of a `timePlot` Figure. These annotations have been subsequently added
to a basic plot and built up in layers. This section
considers how to annotate [openair]{.pkg} plots more generally and uses Figure
\@ref(fig:timePlotAnnotate) as an example of the types of
annotation possible. Also considered specifically is the annotation of
plots that are in polar coordinates, as these can sometimes benefit
from different types of annotation.

There are several types of objects that can be useful to add
to plots including text, shapes, lines and other shading. Given that
many [openair]{.pkg} plots can consist of multiple panels, it is also useful
to think about how to annotate specific panels. The examples given in
this section will apply to all [openair]{.pkg} plot, the only difference
being the coordinate system used in each case.

The basis of [openair]{.pkg} annotations is through the use of the
[latticeExtra]{.pkg} package, which should already be installed as part
of [openair]{.pkg}. In that package there is a function called `layer`
that effectively allows annotations to be built up 'layer by layer'.

## Adding text

To add text (or other annotations) it is necessary to know the
coordinates on a plot for where the text will go, which will depend on
the data plotted. In this extended example using the `timePlot`
function, the y-axis will be in ordinary numerical units, whereas the
x-axis will be in a date-time format (`POSIXct`).

There are various ways that annotations can be added, but the method
used here is to add to the previous plot using a function called
`trellis.last.object()` to which we want to add a later. This may
seem complicated, but once a few examples are considered, the method
becomes very powerful, flexible and straightforward. In a multi-panel
plot such as Figure \@ref(fig:timePlotAnnotate) it is also useful to
specify which rows/columns should be added to. If they are not
specified then the annotation will appear in all panels.

First, a plot should be produced to which we wish to add some text.

```{r annotatePbase, eval=FALSE}
## make sure latticeExtra is loaded
library(openair)
library(lubridate)
library(latticeExtra)
timePlot(selectByDate(mydata, year = 2003, month = "aug"),
         pollutant = c("nox", "o3", "pm25", "pm10", "ws"),
         y.relation = "free")
```

So, considering \@ref(fig:timePlotAnnotate), this is how the text
`some missing data' was added to the top panel.

```{r annotateP1, eval=FALSE}
trellis.last.object() +
    layer(ltext(x = ymd_hm("2003-08-04 12:00"), y = 200,
                labels = "some missing data"), rows = 1)
```

So what does this do? First, the `trellis.last.object()` is simply
the last plot that was plotted. Next the `layer` function is used
to add some text. The text itself is added using the `ltext`
[lattice]{.pkg} function. It is worth having a look at the help for
`ltext` as that gives an overview of all the common annotations and
other options. We have chosen to plot the text at position x =
'2003-08-04' and y = 200 and the label itself. A useful option to
`ltext` is `pos`. Values can be 1, 2, 3 and 4, and indicate
positions below (the default), to the left of, above and to the right
of the specified coordinates

## Adding text and a shaded area

This time we will highlight an interval in row 2 (O~3~) and write
some text on top. Note that this time we use the `lpolygon`
function and choose to put it under everything else on the plot. For
the text, we have chosen a colour (yellow) font type 2 (bold) and made
it a bit bigger (`cex = 1.5`). Note also the `y` values extend
beyond the actual limits shown on the plot --- just to make sure they
cover the whole region.

The polygon could of course be horizontal and more than one producing
a series of 'bands' e.g. air quality indexes. A more sophisticated
approach is shown later for PM~2.5~

```{r annotateP2, eval=FALSE}
## add shaded polygon
trellis.last.object() +
    layer(lpolygon(x = c(ymd_hm("2003-08-07 00:00"),
                   ymd_hm("2003-08-07 00:00"), ymd_hm("2003-08-12 00:00"),
                   ymd_hm("2003-08-12 00:00")), y = c(-20, 600, 600, -20),
                   col = "grey", border = NA), under = TRUE, rows = 2)
## add text
trellis.last.object() +
    layer(ltext(x = ymd_hm("2003-08-09 12:00"), y = 50,
                labels = "!!episode!!", col = "yellow",
                font = 2, cex = 1.5), rows = 2)
```

The small shaded, semi-transparent area shown in the bottom panel was
added as follows:

```{r annotateP2a, eval=FALSE}
## add shaded polygon
plt <- plt +
    layer(lpolygon(x = c(ymd("2003-08-21"), ymd("2003-08-21"),
                   ymd_hm("2003-08-23 00:00"), ymd_hm("2003-08-23 00:00")),
                   y = c(4, 8, 8, 4), col = "blue", border = NA,
                   alpha = 0.2), rows = 5)
```


## Adding an arrow

The arrow shown on the first panel of Figure \@ref(fig:timePlotAnnotate)
was added as follows. Note the `code = 3` placed arrows at both
ends. Note that `angle` is the angle from the shaft of the arrow to
the edge of the arrow head.

```{r annotateP3, eval=FALSE}
trellis.last.object() +
    layer(larrows(ymd_hm("2003-08-01 00:00"), 100,
                  ymd_hm("2003-08-08 14:00"),
                  100, code = 3, angle = 30), rows = 1)
```

## Adding a reference line and text

This code adds a vertical dashed reference line shown in the 4th panel
(PM~10~) along with some text aligned at 90 degrees using the
`srt` option of `ltext`.

```{r annotateP4, eval=FALSE}
trellis.last.object() +
    layer(panel.abline(v = ymd_hm("2003-08-25 00:00"), lty = 5),
          rows = 4)
trellis.last.object() +
    layer(ltext(x = ymd_hm("2003-08-25 08:00"), y = 60,
                labels = "reference line", srt = 90), rows = 4)
```

## Highlight a specific point

Up until now annotations have been added using arbitrary coordinates in
each panel. What if we wanted to highlight a particular point, or more
generally work with the actual data that are plotted. Knowing how to
refer to existing data greatly extends the power of these functions.

It is possible to refer to a specific point in a panel simply by
indexing the point of interest i.e. `x`, `y`. For example, to
mark the 200th PM~10~ concentration (without knowing the actual date
or value):

```{r annotateP5, eval=FALSE}
## add a specfic point
trellis.last.object() +
    layer(lpoints(x[200], y[200], pch = 16, cex = 1.5),
          rows = 4)
```

What if we wanted to highlight the maximum O~3~ concentration? It is
possible to work out the index first and then use that to refer to
that point. Note the `}` to allow for the code to span multiple
commands.

```{r annotateP6, eval=FALSE}
## add a point to the max O3 concentration
trellis.last.object() +
    layer({maxy <- which.max(y);
           lpoints(x[maxy], y[maxy], col = "black", pch = 16)},
          rows = 2)

## label max ozone
trellis.last.object() +
    layer({maxy <- which.max(y);
           ltext(x[maxy], y[maxy], paste(y[maxy], "ppb"),
                 pos = 4)}, rows = 2)
```

## Add a filled polygon

It can be seen in the top panel of Figure \@ref(fig:timePlotAnnotate) that
some data are highlighted by filling the area below the line. This
approach can be useful more generally in plotting. While it is
possible to draw polygons easily and refer to the data itself, there
needs to be a way for dealing with gaps in data, otherwise these gaps
could be filled in perhaps unpredictable ways. A function has been
written to draw a polygon taking into account gaps (`poly.na`).

```{r polyNA, eval=FALSE}
poly.na <- function(x1, y1, x2, y2, col = "black", alpha = 0.2) {
  for(i in seq(2, length(x1)))
    if (!any(is.na(y2[c(i - 1, i)])))
      lpolygon(c(x1[i - 1], x1[i], x2[i], x2[i - 1]),
               c(y1[i - 1], y1[i], y2[i], y2[i - 1]),
               col = col, border = NA, alpha = alpha)
}
```

This time we work out the ids of the data spanning an area of
interest. Then the `poly.na` function is used. Note that the alpha
transparency is by default 0.2 but another value can easily be
supplied, as shown in the air quality 'bands' example.

```{r annotateP7, eval=FALSE}
trellis.last.object() +
    layer({id <- which(x >= ymd_hm("2003-08-11 00:00") &
                       x <= ymd_hm("2003-08-25 00:00"));
           poly.na(x[id], y[id], x[id], rep(0, length(id)),
                   col = "darkorange")}, rows = 1)
```

## Add air quality bands as polygons

It is a simple extension to go from using a polygon below the data to
polygons at certain intervals e.g. air quality indexes. These are
shown for PM~2.5~ and the bands considered are 0--20, 20--30, 30--40
and >40.

```{r annotateP8, eval=FALSE}
trellis.last.object() +
    layer(poly.na(x, y, x, rep(0, length(x)),
                  col = "green", alpha = 1), rows = 3)
trellis.last.object() +
    layer(poly.na(x, ifelse(y <20, NA, y), x,
                  rep(20, length(x)), col = "yellow", alpha = 1),
          rows = 3)
trellis.last.object() +
    layer(poly.na(x, ifelse(y <30, NA, y),
                  x, rep(30, length(x)),
                  col = "orange", alpha = 1), rows = 3)
trellis.last.object() +
    layer(poly.na(x, ifelse(y <40, NA, y),
                  x, rep(40, length(x)),
                  col = "red", alpha = 1), rows = 3)
```

## Polar plot examples

Many of the examples considered above are relevant to all other
functions e.g. how to add text, choosing rows and columns to plot
in. Polar coordinate plots are different because of the coordinate
system used and this section considers a few examples.

One useful approach is to be able to draw an arc, perhaps highlighting
an area of interest. A simple, but flexible function has been written
to do this. It takes arguments `theta1` and `theta2` that define
the angular area of interest and `lower` and `upper` to set the
lower and upper wind speed, respectively. It also has additional
arguments `theta3` and `theta4` which optionally set the angles
for the 'upper' wind speed.

```{r arcCode}
arc <- function(theta1 = 30, theta2 = 60, theta3 = theta1, theta4 = theta2,
                lower = 1, upper = 10){
  ## function to work out coordinates for an arc sector
  if (theta2 < theta1) {
    ang1 <- seq(theta1, 360, length = abs(theta2 - theta1))
    ang2 <- seq(0, theta2, length = abs(theta2 - theta1))
    angles.low <- c(ang1, ang2)

    ## for upper angles
    ang1 <- seq(theta1, 360, length = abs(theta4 - theta3))
    ang2 <- seq(0, theta2, length = abs(theta4 - theta3))
    angles.high <- c(ang1, ang2)

  } else {
    angles.low <- seq(theta1, theta2, length = abs(theta2 - theta1))
    angles.high <- seq(theta3, theta4, length = abs(theta4 - theta3))
  }
  x1 <- lower * sin(pi * angles.low / 180)
  y1 <- lower * cos(pi * angles.low / 180)
  x2 <- rev(upper * sin(pi * angles.high / 180))
  y2 <- rev(upper * cos(pi * angles.high / 180))
  data.frame(x = c(x1, x2), y = c(y1, y2))

}
```


```{r annonatePolar,fig.keep='last',fig.width=5,fig.height=5,out.width='50%', echo =FALSE,fig.cap='Annotations on a polar plot.'}
arc <- function(theta1 = 30, theta2 = 60, theta3 =theta1, theta4 = theta2,
                lower = 1, upper = 10){
  ## function to work out coordinates for an arc sector
  if (theta2 < theta1) {
    ang1 <- seq(theta1, 360, length= abs(theta2 - theta1))
    ang2 <- seq(0, theta2, length = abs(theta2 - theta1))
    angles.low <- c(ang1, ang2)

    ## for upper angles
    ang1 <- seq(theta1, 360, length = abs(theta4 - theta3))
    ang2 <- seq(0, theta2, length = abs(theta4 - theta3))
    angles.high <- c(ang1, ang2)

  } else {
    angles.low <- seq(theta1, theta2, length = abs(theta2 - theta1))
    angles.high <- seq(theta3, theta4, length = abs(theta4 - theta3))
  }
  x1 <- lower * sin(pi * angles.low / 180)
  y1 <- lower * cos(pi * angles.low / 180)
  x2 <- rev(upper * sin(pi * angles.high / 180))
  y2 <- rev(upper * cos(pi * angles.high / 180))
  data.frame(x = c(x1, x2), y = c(y1, y2))

}

plt <- polarPlot(mydata, pollutant = "so2", col = "jet")$plot
plt <- plt + layer(ltext(-12, -12, "A", cex = 2))
plt <- plt + layer(ltext(10, 1, "B", cex = 2, col= "white"))
plt <- plt + layer(lsegments(0, 0, -11.5, -11.5, lty = 5))
plt <- plt +
    layer(lpolygon(x = arc(theta1 = 60, theta2 = 120,
                   lower = 2, upper = 15)$x,
                   y = arc(theta1 = 60, theta2 = 120,
                   lower = 2, upper = 15)$y, lty = 1, lwd = 2))
plt
```

Following on from the previous examples, some annotations have been
added to the basic polar plor for SO~2~ as shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:annonatePolar). Note that in these plots (0, 0) is the
middle of the plot and the radial distance will be determined by the
wind speed --- or whatever the radial variable is. This way of
plotting arcs can also be applied to other functions that show
directional data.

```{r annotatePolar1, eval=FALSE}
polarPlot(mydata, pollutant = "so2", col = "jet")
trellis.last.object() + layer(ltext(-12, -12, "A", cex = 2))
trellis.last.object() + layer(ltext(10, 2, "B", cex = 2, col = "white"))
trellis.last.object() + layer(lsegments(0, 0, -11.5, -11.5, lty = 5))
## add and arc to highlight area of interest
trellis.last.object() +
    layer(lpolygon(x = arc(theta1 = 60, theta2 = 120, lower = 2,
                   upper = 15)$x, y = arc(theta1 = 60,
                                  theta2 = 120, lower = 2,
                                  upper = 15)$y, lty = 1, lwd = 2))
```

## Using grid graphics --- identify locations interactively

The examples above provide a precise way of annotating plots for
single or multi-panels [openair]{.pkg} displays. However, these methods won't
work for plots that consist of completely separate plots such as the
four plots in `timeVariation`. There are however other methods that
can be used to annotate such plots using the package `grid`, which
forms the basis of [lattice]{.pkg} graphics. There is enormous capability
for annotating plots using the `grid` package and only a few simple
examples are given here.

Given a a basic `timeVariation` plot, how could texts be added
at any location --- say in the middle monthly plot? One very useful
function for this type of annotation that allows the user to
interactively choose a location is the `grid.locator()` function in
the `grid` package. That function can be called with different
coordinate systems --- but the one we want defines the bottom-left
corner as (0, 0) and the top right as (1, 1).

First, make a `timeVariation` plot.

```{r timeVarGrid, eval=FALSE}
timeVariation(mydata)
```

Now let's choose a location on the plot interactively using the mouse
and selecting somewhere in the middle of the monthly plot.

```{r gridLocate, eval=FALSE}
library(grid)
## bring up the interactive location chooser
grid.locator(unit = "npc")
```

What should happen is that in the R console the coordinates are given
for that point. In my case these were x = 0.503 and y = 0.338. These
coordinates can now be used as the basis of adding some text or other
annotation. In the example below, the `grid.text` function is used
to add some text for these coordinates making the font bigger (`cex
= 2`), bold (`font = 2`) and blue (`col = "blue"`).

```{r addGridText, eval=FALSE}
grid.text(x = 0.503, y = 0.338, label = "here!",
          gp = gpar(cex = 2, font = 2, col = "blue"))
```

Even with this basic approach, some sophisticated annotation is
possible with *any* [openair]{.pkg} plot. There are many other functions
that can be used from the grid package that would allow for polygons,
segments and other features to be drawn is a similar way to the
examples earlier in this section. Continuing with the same example,
here is how to add an arrow pointing to the maximum \nox concentration
shown on the top plot for Saturday (again using the `grid.locator`
function).

```{r addGridArrow, eval=FALSE}
grid.lines(x = c(0.736, 0.760), y = c(0.560, 0.778),
           arrow = arrow())
grid.text(x = 0.736, y = 0.560, label = "maximum", just = "left")
```
