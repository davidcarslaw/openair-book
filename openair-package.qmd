# The openair package {#openair-package}

In this book two packages are frequently used and it is a good idea to load both.

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(openair)
library(tidyverse)
```

Because the [openair]{.pkg} package (and R itself) are continually updated, it will be useful to know this document was produced using R version `r getRversion()` and [openair]{.pkg} version `r packageDescription("openair", field = "Version")`.

## Installation and code access

[openair]{.pkg} is avaiable on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) (Comprehensive R Archive network) which means it can be installed easily from R. I would recommend re-starting R and then type `install.packages("openair")`. If you use [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) (which is *highly* recommended), you can just choose the 'packages' tab on the bottom-right, and then select 'Install'. Simply start typing openair and you will find the package.

For [openair]{.pkg} all development is carried out using Github for version control. Users can access all code used in openair at (<https://github.com/davidcarslaw/openair>).

Sometimes it might be useful to install the development version of [openair]{.pkg} and you can find instructions [here](https://github.com/davidcarslaw/openair).

## Input data requirements

The [openair]{.pkg} package applies certain constraints on input data requirements. **It is important to adhere to these requirements to ensure that data are correctly formatted for use in** [openair]{.pkg}. The principal reason for insisting on specific input data format is that there will be less that can go wrong and it is easier to write code for a more limited set of conditions.

-   Data should be in a data frame (or `tibble`).

-   **The date/time field should be called `date`** --- note the lower case. No other name is acceptable.

-   **The wind speed and wind direction should be named `ws` and `wd`**, respectively (note again, lower case). Wind directions follow the UK Met Office format and are represented as degrees from north e.g. 90 degrees is east. North is taken to be 360 degrees

-   Where fields should have numeric data e.g. concentrations of NO~x~, then the user should ensure that no other characters are present in the column, accept maybe something that represents missing data e.g. 'no data'. 

-   Other variables names can be upper/lower case *but should not start with a number*. If column names do have white spaces, R will automatically replace them with a full-stop. While `PM2.5` as a field name is perfectly acceptable, it is a pain to type it in---better just to use `pm25` ([openair]{.pkg} will recognise pollutant names like this and automatically format them as PM~2.5~ in plots).

## Brief overview of openair {#brief-intr-open}

This section gives a brief overview of the functions in [openair]{.pkg}. Having read some data into a data frame it is then straightforward to run any function. Almost all functions are run as:

```{r eval=FALSE}
functionName(thedata, options, ...)
```

The usage is best illustrated through a specific example, in this case the `polarPlot` function. The details of the function are shown in @sec-polarPlot) and through the help pages (type ?polarPlot). As it can be seen there are numerous options associated with `polarPlot` --- and most other functions and each of these has a default. For example, the default pollutant considered in `polarPlot` is `nox`. If the user has a data frame called `theData` then `polarPlot` could minimally be called by:

```{r eval=FALSE}
polarPlot(theData)
```

which would plot a `nox` polar plot if `nox` was available in the data frame `theData`.

Note that the options do not need to be specified in order nor is it always necessary to write the whole word. For example, it is possible to write:

```{r eval=FALSE}
polarPlot(theData, type = "year", poll = "so2")
```

In this case writing `poll` is sufficient to uniquely identify that the option is `pollutant`.

Also there are many common options available in functions that are not explicitly documented, but are part of lattice graphics. Some common ones are summarised in @tbl-options. The `layout` option allows the user to control the layout of multi-panel plots e.g. `layout = c(4, 1)` would ensure a four-panel plot is 4 columns by 1 row.

```{r echo=FALSE}

tab_dat <- tibble(
  option = c("xlab", "ylab", "main", "pch", "cex", "lty", 
             "lwd", "layout"),
  description = c("x-axis label", "y-axis label", "title of the plot",
                  "plotting symbol used for points",
                  "size of symbol plotted",
                  "line type",
                  "line width",
                  "the plot layout e.g. c(2, 2) "
                  )
)
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-options
#| tbl-cap: 'Common options used in [openair]{.pkg} plots that can be set by the user but are generally not explicitly documented.'
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(tab_dat, booktabs = TRUE)
```

## The type option

One of the central themes in [openair]{.pkg} is the idea of *conditioning*. Rather than plot $x$ against $y$, considerably more information can usually be gained by considering a third variable, $z$. In this case, $x$ is plotted against $y$ for many different intervals of $z$. This idea can be further extended. For example, a trend of NO~x~ against time can be *conditioned* in many ways: NO~x~ vs. time split by wind sector, day of the week, wind speed, temperature, hour of the day ... and so on. This type of analysis is rarely carried out when analysing air pollution data, in part because it is time consuming to do. However, thanks to the capabilities of R and packages such as [lattice]{.pkg} and [ggplot2]{.pkg}, it becomes easier to work in this way.

In most [openair]{.pkg} functions conditioning is controlled using the `type` option. `type` can be any other variable available in a data frame (numeric, character or factor). A simple example of `type` would be a variable representing a 'before' and 'after' situation, say a variable called `period` i.e. the option `type = "period"` is supplied. In this case a plot or analysis would be separately shown for 'before' and 'after'. When `type` is a numeric variable then the data will be split into four *quantiles* and labelled accordingly. Note however the user can set the quantile intervals to other values using the option `n.levels`. For example, the user could choose to plot a variable by different levels of temperature. If `n.levels = 3` then the data could be split by 'low', 'medium' and 'high' temperatures, and so on. Some variables are treated in a special way. For example if `type = "wd"` then the data are split into 8 wind sectors (N, NE, E, ...) and plots are organised by points of the compass.

There are a series of pre-defined values that `type` can take related to the temporal components of the data as summarised in @tbl-openairType. To use these there *must* be a `date` field so that it can be calculated. These pre-defined values of `type` are shown below are both useful and convenient. Given a data frame containing several years of data it is easy to analyse the data e.g. plot it, by year by supplying the option `type = "year"`. Other useful and straightforward values are "hour" and "month". When `type = "season"` [openair]{.pkg} will split the data by the four seasons (winter = Dec/Jan/Feb etc.). Note for southern hemisphere users that the option `hemisphere = "southern"` can be given. When `type = "daylight"` is used the data are split between nighttime and daylight hours. In this case the user can also supply the options `latitude` and `longitude` for their location (the default is London).

```{r echo=FALSE}

tab_type <- tibble(
  option = c("'year'", "'month'", "'week'", "'monthyear'", "'season'", 
             "'weekday'", "'weekend'", "'daylight'", "'dst'", "'wd'", "'seasonyear'"
             ),
  description = c("splits data by year", 
                  "splits data by month of the year", 
                  "splits data by week of the year",
                  "splits data by year *and* month",
                  "splits data by season. Note in this case the user can also supply a `hemisphere` option that can be either 'northern' (default) or 'southern'",
                  "splits data by day of the week",
                  "splits data by Saturday, Sunday, weekday",
                  " splits data by nighttime/daytime. Note the user must supply a `longitude` and `latitude`",
  "splits data by daylight saving time and non-daylight saving time",
  "if wind direction (`wd`) is available `type = 'wd'` will split the data into 8 sectors: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW",
  " will split the data into year-season intervals, keeping the months of a season together. For example, December 2010 is considered as part of winter 2011 (with January and February 2011). This makes it easier to consider contiguous seasons. In contrast, `type = 'season'` will just split  the data into four seasons regardless of the year."
                  )
)
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-openairType
#| tbl-cap: 'Built-in ways of splitting data in [openair]{.pkg} using the `type` option that is available for most functions.'
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(
  tab_type, booktabs = TRUE
)
```

If a categorical variable is present in a data frame e.g. `site` then that variables can be used directly e.g. `type = "site"`.

In some cases it is useful to categorise numeric variables according to one's own intervals. One example is air quality bands where concentrations might be described as "good", "fair", "bad". For this situation we can use the `cut` function. In the example below, concentrations of NO~2~ are divided into intervals 0-50, 50-100, 100-150 and \>150 using the `breaks` option. Also shown are user-defined labels. Note there is 1 more break than label. There are a couple of thing sto note here. First, `include.lowest = TRUE` ensures that the lowest value is included in the lowest break (in this case 0). Second, the maximum value (1000) is set to be more than the maximum value in the data to ensure the final break encompasses all the data.

### Make your own type

In some cases it is useful to categorise numeric variables according to one's own intervals. One example is air quality bands where concentrations might be described as "good", "fair", "bad". For this situation we can use the `cut` function. In the example below, concentrations of NO~2~ are divided into intervals 0-50, 50-100, 100-150 and \>150 using the `breaks` option. Also shown are user-defined labels. Note there is 1 more break than label. There are a couple of things to note here. First, `include.lowest = TRUE` ensures that the lowest value is included in the lowest break (in this case 0). Second, the maximum value (1000) is set to be more than the maximum value in the data to ensure the final break encompasses all the data.

```{r}
mydata$intervals <- cut(mydata$no2, 
                        breaks = c(0, 50, 100, 150, 1000), 
                        labels = c("Very low", "Low", "High",
                                   "Very High"), 
                        include.lowest = TRUE)

# look at the data
head(mydata)
```

Then it is possible to use the new `intervals` variable in most [openair]{.pkg} functions e.g. `windRose(mydata, type = "intervals")`.

A special case is splitting data by date. In this scenario there might be interest in a 'before-after' situation e.g. due to an intervention. The [openair]{.pkg} function `splitByDate` should make this easy. Here is an example:

```{r splitbydate}
splitByDate(
  mydata,
  dates = "1/1/2003",
  labels = c("before", "after"),
  name = "scenario"
)
```

This code adds a new column `scenario` that is labelled `before` and `after` depending on the date. Note that the `dates` input by the user is in British format (dd/mm/YYYY) and that several dates (and labels) can be provided.

## Controlling font size {#font-size}

All [openair]{.pkg} plot functions have an option `fontsize`. Users can easily vary the size of the font for each plot e.g.

```{r eval=FALSE}
polarPlot(mydata, fontsize = 20)
```

The font size will be reset to the default sizes once the plot is complete. Finer control of individual font sizes is currently not easily possible.

## Using colours {#colours}

Many of the functions described require that colour scales are used; particularly for plots showing surfaces. It is only necessary to consider using other colours if the user does not wish to use the default scheme, shown at the top of @fig-colours. The choice of colours does seem to be a vexing issue as well as something that depends on what one is trying to show in the first place. For this reason, the colour schemes used in [openair]{.pkg} are very flexible: if you don't like them, you can change them easily. R itself can handle colours in many sophisticated ways; see for example the `RColorBrewer` package.

Several pre-defined colour schemes are available to make it easy to plot data. In fact, for most situations the default colour schemes should be adequate. The choice of colours can easily be set; either by using one of the pre-defined schemes or through a user-defined scheme. More details can be found in the [openair]{.pkg} `openColours` function. Some defined colours are shown in @fig-colours, together with an example of a user defined scale that provides a smooth transition from yellow to blue.

```{r}
#| label: fig-colours
#| fig-cap: elected pre-defined colour scales in. The top colour scheme is a user-defined one.
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 7
#| out-width: 70%
library(openair)
## small function for plotting
printCols <- function(col, y) {
    rect((0:200) / 200, y, (1:201) / 200, y + 0.1, col = openColours(col, n = 201),
         border = NA)
    text(0.5, y + 0.15, deparse(substitute(col)))
}

## plot an empty plot
plot(1, xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1.6), type = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "",
     axes = FALSE)
printCols("default", 0)
printCols("increment", 0.2)
printCols("heat", 0.4)
printCols("jet", 0.6)
printCols("viridis", 0.8)
printCols("inferno", 1.0)
printCols("greyscale", 1.2)
printCols(c("tomato", "white", "forestgreen" ), 1.4)
```

The user-defined scheme is very flexible and the following provides examples of its use. In the examples shown next, the `polarPlot` function is used as a demonstration of their use.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# use default colours - no need to specify
polarPlot(mydata)

# use pre-defined "jet" colours
polarPlot(mydata, cols = "jet")

# define own colours going from yellow to green
polarPlot(mydata, cols = c("yellow", "green"))

# define own colours going from red to white to blue
polarPlot(mydata, cols = c("red", "white", "blue"))
```

For more detailed information on using appropriate colours, have a look at the [colorspace](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/colorspace/vignettes/colorspace.html) package. [colorspace]{.pkg} provides the definitive, comprehensive approach to using colours effectively. You will need to install the package, `install.packages("colorspace")`. To use the palettes with [openair]{.pkg}, you can for example do:


```{r,fig.width=4.5,fig.height=4.5,out.width='50%'}
library(colorspace)
library(openair)
windRose(mydata, cols = qualitative_hcl(4, palette = "Dark 3"))
```

## Automatic text formatting {#quickText}

[openair]{.pkg} tries to automate the process of annotating plots. It can be time-consuming (and tricky) to repetitively type in text to represent μg m^-3^ or PM~10~ (μg m^-3^) etc. in R. For this reason, an attempt is made to automatically detect strings such as `nox` or `NOx` and format them correctly. Where a user needs a y-axis label such as NO~x~ (μg m^-3^) it will only be necessary to type `ylab = "nox (ug/m3)"`. The same is also true for plot titles.

Users can override this option by setting it to FALSE.

## Multiple plots on a page {#sec-multiple-plots-page}

We often get asked how to combine multiple plots on one page. Recent changes to [openair]{.pkg} makes this a bit easier. Note that because [openair]{.pkg} uses [lattice]{.pkg} graphics the base graphics \`par} settings will not work.

It is possible to arrange plots based on a column $\times$ row layout. Let's put two plots side by side (2 columns, 1 row). First it is necessary to assign the plots to a variable:

```{r eval=FALSE}
a <- windRose(mydata)
b <- polarPlot(mydata)
```

Now we can plot them using the split option:

```{r eval=FALSE}
print(a, split = c(1, 1, 2, 1))
print(b, split = c(2, 1, 2, 1), newpage = FALSE)
```

In the code above for the `split` option, the last two numbers give the overall layout (2, 1) --- 2 columns, 1 row. The first two numbers give the column/row index for that particular plot. The last two numbers remain constant across the series of plots being plotted.

There is one difficulty with plots that already contain sub-plots such as `timeVariation` where it is necessary to identify the particular plot of interest (see the `timeVariation` help for details). However, say we want a polar plot (`b` above) and a diurnal plot:

```{r eval=FALSE}
c <- timeVariation(mydata)
print(b, split = c(1, 1, 2, 1))
print(c, split = c(2, 1, 2, 1), subset = "hour", newpage = FALSE)
```

For more control it is possible to use the `position` argument. `position` is a vector of 4 numbers, c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) that give the lower-left and upper-right corners of a rectangle in which the plot is to be positioned. The coordinate system for this rectangle is [0--1] in both the x and y directions.

As an example, consider plotting the first plot in the lower left quadrant and the second plot in the upper right quadrant:

```{r eval=FALSE}
print(a, position = c(0, 0, 0.5, 0.5), more = TRUE)
print(b, position = c(0.5, 0.5, 1, 1))
```

The position argument gives more fine control over the plot location.
