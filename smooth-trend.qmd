# Smooth trends  {#sec-smoothTrend}

## Background {#sec-SmoothTrendInfo}

The `smoothTrend` function calculates smooth trends in the
monthly mean concentrations of pollutants. In its basic use it will
generate a plot of monthly concentrations and fit a smooth line to the
data and show the 95% confidence intervals of the fit. The smooth
line is essentially determined using Generalized Additive Modelling
using the [mgcv]{.pkg} package. This package provides a comprehensive
and powerful set of methods for modelling data. In this case, however,
the *model* is a relationship between time and pollutant
concentration i.e. a trend. One of the principal advantages of this
approach is that the amount of smoothness in the trend is optimised in
the sense that it is neither too smooth (therefore missing important
features) nor too variable (perhaps fitting 'noise' rather than real
effects). Some background information on the use of this approach in
an air quality setting can be found in @Carslaw2007a.

@sec-trends-gam considers smooth trends in more detail and
considers how different models can be developed that can be quite
sophisticated. Readers should consider this section if they are
considering trend analysis in more depth.

The user can select to deseasonalise the data first to provide a
clearer indication of the overall trend on a monthly basis. The data
are deseasonalised using the `stl` function. The user may also
select to use bootstrap simulations to provide an alternative method
of estimating the uncertainties in the trend. In addition, the
simulated estimates of uncertainty can account for autocorrelation in
the residuals using a block bootstrap approach.


## Examples of trend analysis
We apply the function to concentrations of O~3~ and NO~2~ using the
code below. The first plot shows the smooth trend in raw O~3~
concentrations, which shows a very clear seasonal cycle. By removing
the seasonal cycle of O~3~, a better indication of the trend is
given, shown in the second plot. Removing the seasonal cycle is more
effective for pollutants (or locations) where the seasonal cycle is
stronger e.g. for ozone and background
sites. @fig-smoothTrendComp shows the results of the simulations
for NO~2~ without the seasonal cycle removed. It is clear from this
plot that there is little evidence of a seasonal cycle. The principal
advantage of the smoothing approach compared with the Theil-Sen method
is also clearly shown in this plot. Concentrations of NO~2~ first
decrease, then increase strongly. The trend is therefore not
monotonic, violating the Theil-Sen assumptions. Finally, the last plot
shows the effects of first deaseasonalising the data: in this case
with little effect.

            main = "monthly mean o3")

smoothTrend(mydata, pollutant = "o3", deseason = TRUE, ylab = "concentration (ppb)",
            main = "monthly mean deseasonalised o3")

smoothTrend(mydata, pollutant = "no2", simulate = TRUE, ylab = "concentration (ppb)",
            main = "monthly mean no2 (bootstrap uncertainties)")

smoothTrend(mydata, pollutant = "no2", deseason = TRUE, simulate =TRUE,
            ylab = "concentration (ppb)",
            main = "monthly mean deseasonalised no2 (bootstrap uncertainties)")
```


The `smoothTrend` function share many of the functionalities of
the `TheilSen` function. @fig-smoothwd shows the
result of applying this function to O~3~ concentrations. The code
that produced @fig-smoothwd) was:

```{r}
#| label: fig-smoothwd
#| fig-cap: Trends in O~3~ using the `smoothTrend` function applied to Marylebone Road. The shading shows the estimated 95% confidence intervals.
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 12
smoothTrend(mydata, pollutant = "o3", deseason = TRUE,
             type = "wd")
```

The `smoothTrend` function can easily be used to gain a large
amount of information on trends easily. For example, how do trends in
NO~2~, O~3~ and PM~10~ vary by season and wind sector. There are 8
wind sectors and four seasons i.e. 32 plots. In @fig-smoothwdSeason all three pollutants are chosen and two
types (season and wind direction). We also reduce the number of axis
labels and the line to improve clarity. There are numerous
combinations of analyses that could be produced here and it is very
easy to explore the data in a wide number of ways.

```{r}
#| label: fig-smoothwdSeason
#| fig-cap: The `smoothTrend` function applied to three pollutants,  split by wind sector and season.
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-height: 12
smoothTrend(mydata, pollutant = c("no2", "pm10", "o3"), 
            type = c("wd", "season"),
            date.breaks = 3, lty = 0)
```

## Seasonal averages

If the interest is in considering seasonal trends, it makes sense to set the averaging time to 'season' and also show each season in a separate panel. In @fig-smoothTrendSeason some data is imported for O~3~ from Lullington Heath on the south coast of England. This plot shows there is strongest evidence for an increase in O~3~ concentrations during springtime from about 2012 onwards. A probable reason for this increase is a general reduction in NO~x~ concentrations.

```{r importLul}
lh <- importAURN(site = "lh", year = 2000:2019)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-smoothTrendSeason
#| fig-cap: Trends in O~3~ by season at the Lullington Heath site with a seasonal averaging time and panel for each season.
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 5
smoothTrend(lh, pollutant = "o3",
            avg.time = "season",
            type = "season",
            date.breaks = 4)
```
