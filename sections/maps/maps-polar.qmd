subtitle: Putting polar plots on an interactive map 
author: Jack Davison
abstract: "One of the headline features of `openairmaps` is creating maps using directional analysis plots as markers. Being able to place a polar plot or similar visualisation on a map can allow us to gain additional insight from our analysis, permitting us to easily compare different sites and further understand their geographic context. This page introduces the `polarMap()` family of functions, and the suite of customisations available to users."

## Data Requirements

[openairmaps]{.pkg} contains the `polar_data` dataset to allow users to test the directional analysis functions^[By "directional analysis", we are referring to the outputs from [openair]{.pkg} functions like `polarPlot()`.]. The structure of this data set is provided below, and a summary is given in @tbl-polardata. The important feature of this data when compared to `openair::mydata` is latitude and longitude information, which [openairmaps]{.pkg} needs to place the directional analysis markers in the correct positions.

```{r}
#| label: glimpsePolar
library(openairmaps)
dplyr::glimpse(polar_data)
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-polardata
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "A statistical summary of the `polar_data` dataset."
polar_data %>%
  dplyr::select(-site_type) %>%
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(
    missing = "no", 
    by = "site",
    type = list(lat ~ "continuous", lon ~ "continuous"),
    statistic = list(lat ~ "{median}", lon ~ "{median}")
  )
```

If you would prefer to use data from different sites or years, the `import*()` functions from [openair]{.pkg} make it easy to obtain pollution data with associated site latitude/longitude. The key thing to remember is to use the `meta = TRUE` argument when using a function like `importUKAQ()` to have the lat/lon (& site type) appended to your imported data.

```{r}
#| label: importlatlon
sunderland <- openair::importUKAQ(site = c("sun2", "sunr"), year = 2015, meta = TRUE)
names(sunderland)
```

## Overview

The easiest way to get polar plots on a map is through the use of the all-in-one mapping functions. These are all named using the pattern `{function-name}Map`, where `{function_name}` is a short hand for the equivalent [openair]{.pkg} function. A reference is provided in @tbl-dirAnalysisRef.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-dirAnalysisRef
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "A reference table for `openairmaps` directional analysis mapping functions."
dplyr::tribble(
  ~ openair,          ~ openairmaps,     ~`scale arguments`, ~ `unique arguments`,
  "`polarAnnulus()`",   "`annulusMap()`",    "`limits`",         "`period`",
  "`polarFreq()`",      "`freqMap()`",       "`breaks`",         "`statistic`",
  "`percentileRose()`", "`percentileMap()`", "`percentile`",     "--",
  "`polarPlot()`",      "`polarMap()`",      "`limits`",         "`x`",
  "`pollutionRose()`",  "`pollroseMap()`",   "`breaks`",         "`statistic`",
  "`windRose()`",       "`windroseMap()`",   "`ws.int`, `breaks`",  "--",
  "`polarDiff()`",      "`diffMap()`",        "`limits`",         "`x`"
) %>%
  gt::gt() %>%
  gt::fmt_markdown(everything())
```

Effectively all of these functions have very similar arguments, although some are unique to the specific function (also shown in @tbl-dirAnalysisRef). The important ones to pay attention to are:

-   `data`: The data you would like to map. Ensure that lat/lon information is present.[^maps-polar-1]

[^maps-polar-1]: `data` is an option for all of the directional analysis maps, with the exception of `diffMap()` which shares the `before` and `after` arguments with `openair::polarDiff()`.

-   `pollutant`: The pollutant(s) of interest. If multiple pollutants are provided, a "layer control" menu will allow readers to swap between them.

-   `latitude`, `longitude`, `crs`: The lat/lon column names. If they are not specified, the functions will attempt to guess them based on common names (e.g., "lon", "lng", "long" and "longitude" for `longitude`). `crs` can be changed from the default if your data uses a different coordinate system, e.g., `crs = 27700` for the British National Grid.

-   `type`: A column to use to create a "layer control" menu. Specifying `type` effectively splits the input data along the specified column, creating multiple separate sets of directional analysis plots. Common columns to pass to `type` will be those created by `openair::cutData()` or `openair::splitByDate()`.[^maps-polar-2]

[^maps-polar-2]: Note that maps can only have one "layer control" menu. Users should therefore only provide multiple pollutants *or* an argument to `type`, but never both. If multiple pollutants *and* `type` are specified, `type` will be ignored.

-   `popup`: A column to be used to create a HTML "popup" that appears when users click the markers. This would be useful to label each marker with its corresponding site name or code, although other information could be usefully included (e.g., site type, average pollutant concentrations, and so on). A more complicated popup can be created using the `buildPopup()` function.

-   `label`: Much the same as "popup", but the message will appear when users hover-over the marker rather than click on it. Labels are often much shorter than popups.

-   `provider`: The [leaflet]{.pkg} base map provider(s) you'd like to use. If multiple providers are provided, a "layer control" menu will allow readers to swap between them. Note that you can provide multiple pollutants *and* providers!

-   The "scale" arguments (e.g., `limits` for `polarMap()`). By specifying a scale, all polar markers will use the same colour scale, making them quantitatively comparable to one another. Specifying a scale will also draw a shared legend at the top-right of the plot, unless `draw.legend` is set to `FALSE`.

-   `alpha`: Controls the transparency of the polar markers, as sometimes making them semi-transparent may be desirable (for examples, if they are slightly overlapping, or seeing more of the basemap is useful). `alpha` should be a number between 0 and 1, where 1 is completely opaque and 0 is completely transparent.

-   The two "marker diameter" arguments, which control the size and resolution of the polar markers. It is assumed that circular markers are desired, so any number provided will be used as the marker width *and* height. If, for whatever reason, a non-circular marker is desired, a vector in the form `c(width, height)` can be provided.

-   `d.icon` changes the actual size of the markers on the map, defaulting to 200.

-   `d.fig` changes the size of the actual `openair` figure, defaulting to 3.5 inches. In practice, this translates to changing the resolution of the figure on the map, so you should look to adjust `d.fig` in the same direction as `d.icon` so that the axis scales remain readable.

-   `...`: Any additional arguments to pass to the equivalent [openair]{.pkg} function.

## Simple Demonstrations

`polarMap()` is demonstrated in @fig-polarMap. Try clicking on each of the markers to see which sites they correspond to.

```{r}
#| label: fig-polarMap
#| fig-cap: "A demonstration of `polarMap()`."
polarMap(
  polar_data,
  pollutant = "nox",
  latitude = "lat",
  longitude = "lon",
  popup = "site"
)
```

Another example, this time using `annulusMap()`, is given in @fig-annulusMap. Note that this time there are two different pollutants plotted, which can be swapped between using the layer control menu. [openairmaps]{.pkg} automatically deals with subscripts in common pollutant names.

```{r}
#| label: fig-annulusMap
#| fig-cap: "A more complex demonstration, this time using `annulusMap()`."
annulusMap(
  polar_data,
  pollutant = c("nox", "no2"), 
  provider = "CartoDB.Positron",
  latitude = "lat",
  longitude = "lon"
)
```

## Colour Scales

@fig-polarMap could be described as using `polarMap()` in a "qualitative" mode --- each site is using its own colour scale, so they cannot be easily compared quantitatively. There are two ways to use `polarMap()` in a more "quantitative" way:

1.  Use the appropriate "scale" argument to set a colour scale that all markers will share. For `polarMap()` (and `annulusMap()`) this is the "limits" argument, which works the same way as in `polarPlot()` (and `annulusPlot()`). In fact, all of the "scales" arguments shown in @tbl-dirAnalysisRef work in the exact same way as their corresponding [openair]{.pkg} function. Setting a shared scale will draw an easy-to-read shared legend, which can be disabled using the `draw.legend` argument.

2.  Set the `key` argument to be `TRUE`, which will draw the colour bar next to each individual marker. This may be advantageous if one site is much more polluted compared to another one, but the individual colour bars can be confusing and difficult to read depending on the chosen base map.

### Shared Scale

```{r}
#| label: fig-polarMapShare
#| fig-cap: "A demonstration of `polarMap()` with a shared colour scale."
polarMap(
  polar_data,
  pollutant = "nox",
  latitude = "lat",
  longitude = "lon",
  popup = "site",
  limits = c(0, 500)
)
```

### Distinct Scales

```{r}
#| label: fig-polarMapDistinct
#| fig-cap: "A demonstration of `polarMap()` with individual colour scales."
polarMap(
  polar_data,
  pollutant = "nox",
  latitude = "lat",
  longitude = "lon",
  popup = "site",
  key = TRUE
)
```
:::

## Use of `type`

@fig-controlMap uses `percentileMap()` and demonstrates how to use the "type" option to create a custom "layer control" menu and "label" and "popup" to label the markers, as well as passing on arguments to the equivalent [openair]{.pkg} function --- in this case, passing the "intervals" argument to `percentileRose()` so that all of the markers are on the same radial axis.

```{r}
#| label: fig-controlMap
#| fig-cap: "A demonstration of `percentileMap()` using the 'type' option and passing arguments to `openair::percentileRose()`."
percentileMap(
  polar_data,
  pollutant = "nox",
  type = "weekend",
  latitude = "lat",
  longitude = "lon", 
  provider = "Esri.WorldTopoMap",
  cols = "viridis",
  popup = "site",
  label = "site_type",
  intervals = c(0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000)
)
```

## Adding Extra Markers

As `{openairmaps}` is built using `{leaflet}`, it is easy to add to your directional analysis maps using `{leaflet}` functions. For example, you may have the latitude and longitude information of different potential nearby sources like busy roads, industrial activity, transport hubs, and so on. @fig-addmarkers shows how you can add an extra marker with an optional popup/label.

Note that, here, the `sources` data frame only has one row, but there is nothing to stop you from having any number of rows corresponding to different potential sources. As long as each source has a distinct latitude and longitude, a unique marker will be placed on the map. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-addmarkers
#| fig-cap: "Adding a `{leaflet}` marker to show nearby sources."
# data frame of lat/lon
sources <-
  data.frame(lat = 51.5167,
             lng = -0.1769,
             site = "Paddington Station")

# make map
polarMap(polar_data, "nox") %>%
  # add markers
  leaflet::addMarkers(data = sources,
                      popup = ~ site,
                      label = ~ site)
```

`{leaflet}` is well documented [here](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), which details many of the other elements you can add to your maps. Just think of the output of the `polarMap()` family to be like the output of `leaflet() %>% addTiles()` and you'll quickly find yourself layering on more markers, shapes, and other useful map features.

## Building Popups

So far, popups have used a single column to label the markers, but you will often want to encode more data than just the site name or type. For example, you may want to use the site name *and* type *and* the average wind speed *and* the dates it was active! To do so, you can use the `buildPopup()` function. This function has a handful of arguments:

-   `data`: the data you are going to use with, e.g., `polarMap()`.

-   `columns`: the columns you would like to encode in your popup. If this is a named list, the names will replace the raw column names in the popup.

-   `latitude` & `longitude`: the decimal latitude/longitude, which `buildPopup()` will use to identify individual sites to create labels for.

-   `type`: optional. This should only be used if you are going to use the `type` option in, e.g., `polarMap()` and you'd expect different popups for the different layers (i.e., it isn't needed for site names/types, but it is needed for pollutant concentrations).

-   `fun.character`, `fun.numeric` & `fun.dttm`: the functions used to summarise character/factor, numeric, and date-time columns. These have nice defaults, but you may wish to override them.

Think of `buildPopup()` as an intermediate between your data and the polar mapping function. All it does on its own is return the input data with a "popup" column appended, which can then be used with the `popup` argument of the mapping function. @fig-buildPopup demonstrates the use of `buildPopup()` --- try swapping between the layers and clicking on each of the markers.

```{r}
#| label: fig-buildPopup
#| fig-cap: "A demonstration of the `buildPopup()` function."
#| message: false
#| warning: false
polar_data %>%
  openair::cutData("weekend") %>%
  buildPopup(
    columns = c(
      "Site" = "site",
      "Site Type" = "site_type",
      "Date Range" = "date",
      "Average nox" = "nox"
    ),
    type = "weekend"
  ) %>%
  pollroseMap(pollutant = "nox",
              popup = "popup",
              breaks = 6,
              type = "weekend")
```

## Marker Function

The directional analysis marker function is `addPolarMarkers()`, which behaves similarly (but not identically) to `leaflet::addMarkers()`. You will need to define the `data` you're using, the `lat`/`lng`[^maps-polar-3] columns, a column to distinguish different sites (`type`), and an [openair]{.pkg} function (`fun`). As with `leaflet::addMarkers()` and similar functions, you can define `group` and `layerId`, which allows you to create more complex maps than can be achieved using the all-in-one [openairmaps]{.pkg} functions.

[^maps-polar-3]: Marker functions use "lat" and "lng" as argument names for consistency with the leaflet package.

To demonstrate, @fig-polarFreqMap has been created. This uses the `polarFreq()` function to plot multiple polar pollutant frequency plots for oxides of nitrogen. What is different about this map is that users can select the specific statistic they are interested in -- in this case, mean, median or maximum. This is achieved by using the `group` arguments and `addLayersControl()`.

```{r}
#| label: fig-polarFreqMap
#| fig-cap: "Using `addPolarMarkers` to create a more complex map."
library(leaflet)
library(openair)
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Voyager") %>% 
  addPolarMarkers(
    lng = "lon", lat = "lat",
    pollutant = "nox",
    group = "Mean",
    data = polar_data,
    fun = polarFreq,
    statistic = "mean"
  ) %>% 
  addPolarMarkers(
    lng = "lon", lat = "lat",
    pollutant = "nox",
    group = "Median",
    data = polar_data,
    fun = polarFreq,
    statistic = "median"
  ) %>% 
  addPolarMarkers(
    lng = "lon", lat = "lat",
    pollutant = "nox",
    group = "Max",
    data = polar_data,
    fun = polarFreq,
    statistic = "max"
  ) %>%
  addLayersControl(
    baseGroups = c("Mean", "Median", "Max")
  )
```

One could imagine different applications, using this approach. For example:

-   Giving users the option to swap between different `period`s for a `polarAnnulus()` map, or different polar coordinates in a `polarPlot()` map (i.e., different `x` arguments).

-   Allowing users to swap between different plot types (e.g., have "Wind Rose", "Pollution Rose" and "Polar Plot" on the layer control menu).

The options are pretty much endless for the kinds of things you could achieve using this approach. If one of the all-in-one functions doesn't give you the flexibility you need, try to see if you can create your vision yourself from scratch using [leaflet]{.pkg} and the `addPolarMarkers()` function.

## Static Maps

While interactive maps are useful for exploratory analysis and HTML documents/websites, there are numerous situations in which a static directional analysis map may be desired. For example, academic publications often demand submissions which compile to PDF. [openairmaps]{.pkg} provides the `static` argument to facilitate this.

The static maps are designed to be *almost* identical to the interactive maps, with very similar arguments to help easily switch between the two. There are a handful of exceptions, however:

-   Both dynamic and static maps use the `type` argument, but they work in different ways. In static maps, `type` works broadly similarly to the rest of `{openair}` in that it creates separate panels in the same figure in place of having a menu to switch between marker sets. Different panels are also created when multiple `pollutant`s are provided. The arrangement of these panels can be controlled using `static.nrow`.

-   Static maps naturally do not have the `popup` and `label` arguments. However, a benefit of being based in [ggplot2]{.pkg} is that limited further customisation is possible, such as manually adding labels using `ggplot2::geom_sf_label()`.

-   HTML maps use [leaflet]{.pkg}, whereas static maps use [ggplot2]{.pkg} and [ggspatial]{.pkg}. The user-facing significance of this is that the `providers` arguments are slightly different.
