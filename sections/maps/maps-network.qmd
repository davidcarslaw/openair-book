abstract: "Using `importMeta()` provides a simple, tabular data set of monitoring stations. This is useful if users have specific sites, pollutants or local authorities in mind, but it is difficult to get a feel for the geographic distribution of a monitoring network. This section details how `networkMap()` can allow readers to visualise and explore any UK monitoring network."

## Introduction

[openair]{.pkg} makes it easy to access any of the UK's air quality monitoring networks. The following networks are available:

-   The Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN), the UK's national network.

-   The devolved UK networks; Air Quality England (AQE), Scotland (SAQN), Wales (WAQN) and Northern Ireland (NI).

-   Locally managed English networks operated by individual local authorities.

-   The Imperial College London (formerly Kings College London) network.

Lets consider the metadata available for the AURN.

```{r}
#| label: importMeta
library(openair)
aurn_meta <- importMeta(source = "aurn", all = TRUE)
dplyr::glimpse(aurn_meta)
```

This dataset has `r nrow(aurn_meta)` rows and `r ncol(aurn_meta)` columns, which is a lot of information to explore in a tabular format. A more effective way to communicate this information could be a map, which can be created automatically using [openairmaps]{.pkg}.

## The `networkMap()` function

Network visualisation is the simplest family of functions in [openairmaps]{.pkg} --- in fact, it only has one member. `networkMap()` is a function which you can consider as an analogue to `importMeta()` from [openair]{.pkg}. Consider `networkMap()` as an analogue to `importMeta()` --- it can map any of the `source`s that `importMeta()` can, using the same codes (`"aurn"`, `"saqn"`, `"local"`, `"kcl"`, etc.) to select sites. @fig-networkMap visualises the active AURN sites as of `r Sys.Date()`.

```{r}
#| label: fig-networkMap
#| fig-cap: "An interactive map of the AURN monitoring network."
library(openairmaps)
networkMap(source = "aurn")
```

`networkMap()` is a quite simple function, with the following arguments for customisation:

-   `source`: Any number of the `importMeta()` sources --- can be "aurn", "saqn" (or "saqd"), "aqe", "waqn", "ni", "local", "kcl" or "europe".

-   `control`: Any column of the equivalent `importMeta()` dataset, which is used to create a "layer control" menu to allow readers to filter for certain sites. The `control` option is quite opinionated, and selects an appropriate style of layer control depending on the column selected (e.g., pollutants are switched between, whereas multiple site types can be selected at once)

-   `date`: By default, `networkMap()` shows currently active monitoring sites. By specifying `date`, sites active *at that date* will be shown. This may be of interest if you want to explore the history of your chosen monitoring site. Dates can either be provided as a character string in the "YYYY-MM-DD" format, or alternatively as a single year (e.g., `date = 2020`) which will show sites still operational at the *end* of that year.

-   `cluster`: By default, markers are clustered together until users zoom in close. This default behaviour improves the appearance and performance of the HTML map widget. The `cluster` argument allows you to turn this feature off.[^maps-network-1]

-   `provider`: Any number of the [leaflet]{.pkg} providers (see `leaflet::providers` or the list in the [openairmaps overview page](../maps/maps-overview.qmd)).

[^maps-network-1]: This feature cannot be turned off when `network = "europe"` due to the number of markers creating performance issues.

Some of these arguments are demonstrated in @fig-networkMap2, which shows the AURN, AQE Network, and locally managed English networks.[^maps-network-2] Pay particular attention to the layer control menu, which allows you to toggle different site types on and off.

[^maps-network-2]: Note that networks can overlap --- AQE sites can be part of the AURN. `networkMap()` uses the user-provided order as a hierarchy, so if "aurn" is listed first, an AURN & AQE site will be labelled as part of the AURN and its AURN code will be displayed

```{r}
#| label: fig-networkMap2
#| fig-cap: "Demonstrating more features of `networkMap()`."
networkMap(source = c("aurn", "aqe", "local"),
           control = "site_type")
```

### "Do It Yourself" Network Maps

If you are only interested in a few sites, you may wish to create your own, smaller network map. Currently, [openairmaps]{.pkg} only contains functionality to visualise entire networks, but it is relatively easy to create a map of your own using [leaflet]{.pkg}. While @fig-diyNetwork shows a network map of *just* sites in York, its associated code chunk can be used as a template for other small network maps. It uses the `buildPopup()` function from [openairmaps]{.pkg} which was written for use with the [directional analysis mapping functions](../maps/maps-polar.qmd), so is described in greater detail on the next page.

```{r}
#| label: fig-diyNetwork
#| fig-cap: "Demonstrating more features of `networkMap()`."
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

# import all Meta data for the AURN
aurn_meta <- openair::importMeta("aurn", all = TRUE)

# prep data for leaflet
map_data <- 
  aurn_meta %>%
  # get sites in York
  filter(local_authority == "York") %>% 
  # build a popup
  buildPopup(
    latitude = "latitude",
    longitude = "longitude",
    columns = c(
      "AURN Code" = "code",
      "Name" = "site",
      "Site Type" = "site_type",
      "Zone" = "zone",
      "LA" = "local_authority"
    )
  ) %>%
  # get unique sites
  distinct(site, .keep_all = TRUE)

# create a basic leaflet map
leaflet(map_data) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(popup = ~popup)
```

## Searching Networks

`networkMap()` is a useful function to view entire monitoring networks, but your specific use-case may be much more local. The `searchNetwork()` function is designed to find sites local to a specific location of interest, defined using latitude/longitude (or other Y/X) coordinates. You may wish to define your location of interest to be a likely *source*, like an industrial installation, quarry, or the site of a (wild)fire. Alternatively, if you are examining pollutant *exposure* at a specific location (e.g., a school or a hospital) you may wish to find out where the closest air quality monitors are.

For example, let's imagine that we're interested in pollutant concentrations near to Great Ormond Street Hospital, a famous children's hospital in the UK. `{openairmaps}` provides the `convertPostcode()` function to let us easily get the coordinates of this site.

```{r}
#| label: getpostcode
hospital <- convertPostcode("WC1N 3JH")
hospital
```

Let's plug this straight into `searchNetwork()` looking at AURN and AQE sites. @fig-hospitalmap1 is the result - you'll see by default the whole network is returned, far too much detail than we require!

```{r}
#| label: fig-hospitalmap1
#| fig-cap: Searching the whole network!
searchNetwork(
  lat = hospital$lat,
  lng = hospital$lng,
  source = c("aurn", "aqe")
)
```

`searchNetwork()` provides a few arguments to filter down the sites to a more sensible level. These include `site_type` and `variable` which can filter based on the site type and the pollutants measured, `max_dist` to define a maximum distance from the location of interest, and `n` which defines a maximum number of sites to show. All of these constraints are shown on the map at the bottom-right. This is all shown on @fig-hospitalmap2.

```{r}
#| label: fig-hospitalmap2
#| fig-cap: Filtering the metadata down to a sensible level.
searchNetwork(
  lat = hospital$lat,
  lng = hospital$lng,
  source = c("aurn", "aqe"),
  year = 2022,
  max_dist = 2,
  n = 4
)
```

Now we've found our sites, we can instead return them in a table. These could then be plugged straight into `importUKAQ()` and analysed using `{openair}`.

```{r}
#| label: hospitaltbl
hospital_meta <-
  searchNetwork(
    lat = hospital$lat,
    lng = hospital$lng,
    source = c("aurn", "aqe"),
    year = 2022,
    max_dist = 2,
    n = 4,
    map = FALSE
  )

# view table of metadata
hospital_meta
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-hospitalread
#| fig-cap: A timeplot of air quality near Great Ormond Street Hospital.
hospital_aq <-
  openair::importUKAQ(site = hospital_meta$code,
                      year = 2022,
                      source = hospital_meta$source)

openair::timePlot(
  hospital_aq,
  pollutant = c("pm2.5"),
  type = "site",
  avg.time = "day"
)
```
