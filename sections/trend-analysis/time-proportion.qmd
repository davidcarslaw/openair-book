# Time proportion plots {#sec-timeProp}

## Background {#sec-timePropBack}

The `timeProp` ('time proportion') function shows time series plots as stacked bar charts. For a particular time, proportions of a chosen variable are shown as a stacked bar chart. The different categories in the bar chart are made up from a character or factor variable in a data frame. The function is primarily developed to support the plotting of cluster analysis output from `polarCluster` (see @sec-polarCluster) and `trajCluster` (see @sec-trajCluster) that consider local and regional (back trajectory) cluster analysis respectively. However, the function has more general use for understanding time series data. In order to plot time series in this way, some sort of time aggregation is needed, which is controlled by the option `avg.time`.

The plot shows the value of `pollutant` on the y-axis (averaged according to `avg.time`). The time intervals are made up of bars split according to `proportion`. The bars therefore show how the total value of `pollutant` is made up for any time interval.

## Examples {#sec-timePropEx}

An example of the `timeProp` function is shown in @fig-timeProp. In this example SO~2~ concentrations are considered for 2003 (using the `selectByDate` function). The averaging period is set to 3 days and the mean concentration is plotted and the proportion contribution by wind sector is given. Other options are chosen to place the key at the top and choose the number of columns used in the key. It is apparent from @fig-timeProp that the highest SO~2~ concentrations are dominated by winds from an easterly sector, but actually occur throughout the year.

```{r}
#| label: fig-timeProp
#| fig-cap: '`timeProp` plot for SO~2~ concentrations in 2003. The data are categorised into 8 wind sectors for 3-day averages.'
#| fig-width: 15
#| fig-height: 4
#| column: screen-inset-right
library(openair) # load the package

timeProp(selectByDate(mydata, year = 2003),
         pollutant = "so2", avg.time = "3 day",
         proportion = "wd", 
         date.breaks = 10, key.position = "top",
         key.columns = 8, ylab = "so2 (ug/m3)")
```

Note that `proportion` can be an existing categorical (i.e. factor or character) variable in a data frame. If a numeric variable is supplied, then it is typically cut into four quantile levels. So, for example, the plot below would show intervals of wind speed, which would help show the wind speed conditions that control high SO~2~ concentration --- and importantly, when they occur.

An example of using `timeProp` with a continuous variable is shown in @fig-timePropws. In this case the wind speed values are split into 3 quantile levels. The number of quantiles used is determined by the option `n.levels`. This approach can be used for any numeric variables.

```{r}
#| label: fig-timePropws
#| fig-cap: '`timeProp` plot for SO~2~ concentrations in 2003. The data are categorised into 4 wind speed categories for 3-day averages.'
#| fig-width: 15
#| fig-height: 4
#| column: screen-inset-right
timeProp(selectByDate(mydata, year = 2003),
         pollutant = "so2",
         avg.time = "3 day",
         n.levels = 3,
         cols = "viridis",
         proportion = "ws", date.breaks = 10,
         key.position = "top", key.columns = 3)
```

One of the key uses of `timeProp` is to post-process cluster analysis data. Users should consider the uses of `timeProp` for cluster analysis shown in @sec-polarCluster and @sec-trajCluster. In both these cases the cluster analysis yields a categorical output directly i.e. cluster, which lends itself to analysis using `timeProp`.
