# Percentile roses {#percentileRose}

## Introduction

`percentileRose` calculates percentile levels of a pollutant and
plots them by wind direction. One or more percentile levels can be
calculated and these are displayed as either filled areas or as lines.

By default, the function plots percentile concentrations in 10 degree
segments. Alternatively, the levels by wind direction are calculated
using a cyclic smooth cubic spline. The wind directions are rounded to
the nearest 10 degrees, consistent with surface data from the UK Met
Office before a smooth is fitted.

The `percentileRose` function compliments other similar functions
including `windRose`, `pollutionRose`, `polarFreq` or
`polarPlot`. It is most useful for showing the distribution of
concentrations by wind direction and often can reveal different
sources e.g. those that only affect high percentile concentrations
such as a chimney stack.

Similar to other functions, flexible conditioning is available through
the `type} option. It is easy for example to consider multiple
percentile values for a pollutant by season, year and so on. See
examples below.

## Examples

The first example is a basic plot of percentiles of O~3~ shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:percentileRose1).

```{r percentileRose1,fig.width=5,fig.height=5,out.width='50%',fig.cap='A `percentileRose` plot of O~3~ concentrations at Marylebone Road. The percentile intervals are shaded and are shown by wind direction. It shows for example that higher concentrations occur for northerly winds, as expected at this location. However, it also shows, for example the actual value of the 95th percentile O~3~ concentration.'}
library(openair)
percentileRose(mydata, pollutant = "o3")
```

A slightly more interesting plot is shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:percentileRoseSO2) for SO~2~ concentrations. We also
take the opportunity of changing some default options. In this case it
can be clearly seen that the highest concentrations of SO~2~ are
dominated by east and south-easterly winds; likely reflecting the
influence of stack emissions in those directions.

```{r percentileRoseSO2,fig.width=5,fig.height=5,out.width='50%',fig.cap='A `percentileRose` plot of SO~2~ concentrations at Marylebone Road. The percentile intervals are shaded and are shown by wind direction. This plot sets some user-defined percentile levels to consider the higher SO~2~ concentrations, moves the key to the right and uses an alternative colour scheme.'}
percentileRose(mydata, pollutant = "so2",
               percentile = c(25, 50, 75, 90, 95, 99, 99.9),
               col = "brewer1", key.position = "right", smooth = TRUE)
```

Lots more insight can be gained by considering how percentile values
vary by other factors i.e. conditioning. For example, what do O~3~
concentrations look like split by season and whether it is daylight or
nighttime hours? We can set the type to consider season *and*
whether it is daylight or nighttime.^[In choosing `type = "daylight"` the default is to consider a latitude of central
  London (or close to). Users can set the latitude in the function
  call if working in other parts of the world.] This Figure reveals
some interesting features. First, O~3~ concentrations are higher in
the spring and summer and when the wind is from the north. O~3~
concentrations are higher on average at this site in spring due to the
peak of northern hemispheric O~3~ and to some extent local
production. This may also explain why O~3~ concentrations are
somewhat higher at nighttime in spring compared with summer. Second,
peak O~3~ concentrations are higher during daylight hours in summer
when the wind is from the south-east. This will be due to more local
(UK/European) production that is photochemically driven --- and hence
more important during daylight hours.

```{r percentileRoseO3,fig.width=10,fig.height=6,fig.cap='A `percentileRose` plot of O~3~ concentrations at Marylebone Road. The percentile intervals are shaded and are shown by wind direction.The plot shows the variation by season and whether  it is nighttime or daylight hours.'}
percentileRose(mydata, type = c("season", "daylight"), pollutant = "o3",
               col = "Set3", mean.col = "black")
```

## Condtional probability function {#CPF}

The `percentileRose` function can also plot conditional probability
functions (CPF) [@Ashbaugh1985]. The CPF is defined as CPF =
$m_\theta/n_\theta$, where $m_\theta$ is the number of samples in the
wind sector $\theta$ with mixing ratios greater than some `high'
concentration, and $n_\theta$ is the total number of samples in the
same wind sector. CPF analysis is very useful for showing which wind
directions are dominated by high concentrations and give the
probability of doing so. In [openair]{.pkg}, a CPF plot can be produced as
shown in Figure \@ref(fig:percentileRoseCPF). Note that in these plots
only one percentile is provided and the method must be supplied. In Figure
\@ref(fig:percentileRoseCPF) it is clear that the high
concentrations (greater than the 95th percentile of *all*
observations) is dominated by easterly wind directions. There are very
low conditional probabilities of these concentrations being
experienced for other wind directions. 

```{r percentileRoseCPF,fig.width=4.5,fig.height=4.5,out.width='50%',fig.cap='A CPF plot of SO~2~ concentrations at Marylebone Road.'}
percentileRose(mydata, poll="so2", percentile = 95, 
               method = "cpf",
               col = "darkorange", smooth = TRUE)
```

It is easy to plot several species on the same plot and this works
well because they all have the same probability scale (i.e. 0 to
1). In the example below (not shown) it is easy to see for each
pollutant the wind directions that dominate the contributions to the
highest (95th percentile) concentrations. For example, the highest CO
and \nox concentrations are totally dominated by south/south-westerly
winds and the probability of their being such high concentrations from
other wind directions is effectively zero.

```{r CPFExample,fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap='A CPF plot of many pollutants  at Marylebone Road.'}
percentileRose(mydata, 
               pollutant = c("nox", "so2", "o3", "co", "pm10", "pm25"),
               percentile = 95, method = "cpf", col = "darkorange",
               layout = c(3, 2))
```
