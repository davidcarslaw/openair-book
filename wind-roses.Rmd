The wind rose is a very useful way of summarising meteorological
data. It is particularly useful for showing how wind speed and wind
direction conditions vary by year. The `windRose` function can
plot wind roses in a variety of ways: summarising all available wind
speed and wind direction data, plotting individual wind roses by year,
and also by month. The latter is useful for considering how
meteorological conditions vary by season.

Data are summarised by direction, typically by 45 or 30$^\circ$
and by different wind speed categories. Typically, wind speeds are
represented by different width 'paddles'. The plots show the
proportion (here represented as a percentage) of time that the wind is
from a certain angle and wind speed range.

The `windRose` function also calculates the percentage of
'calms' i.e. when the wind speed is zero. UK Met Office data assigns
these periods to 0 degrees wind direction with valid northerly winds
being assigned to 360$^\circ$.

The `windRose` function will also correct for bias when wind
directions are rounded to the nearest 10 degrees but are displayed at
angles that 10 degrees is not exactly divisible into e.g. 22.5$^\circ$. When such data are binned, some angles i.e. N, E, S, W will
comprise three intervals whereas others will comprise two, which can
lead to significant bias. This issue and its solution is discussed by
@droppo2008 and @applequist2012.^[Thanks to Philippe
  Barneoud of Environment Canada for pointing this issue out.]
**openair** uses a simple method to correct for the bias by globally
rescaling the count in each wind direction bin by the number of
directions it represents relative to the average. Thus, the primary
four directions are each reduced by a factor of 0.75 and the remaining
12 directions are multiplied by 1.125.

## Example of use

First we load the packages:

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(openair)
library(tidyverse)
```

The function is very simply called as shown for Figure
\@ref(fig:windrose).

```{r windrose,fig.width=5,fig.height=5,out.width='50%',fig.cap='Use of `windRose` function to plot wind speed/direction frequencies. Wind speeds are split into the intervals shown by the scale in each panel. The grey circles show the % frequencies.'}
windRose(mydata)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:windRoseyear) highlights some interesting differences
between the years. In 2000, for example, there were numerous occasions
when the wind was from the SSW and 2003 clearly had more occasions
when the wind was easterly. It can also be useful to use `type = "month"` to get an idea of how wind speed and direction vary
seasonally.

 ```{r windRoseyear,fig.width=10,fig.height=5,fig.cap='Use of `windRose` function to plot wind speed/direction frequencies by year. Wind speeds are split into the intervals shown by the scale in each panel. The grey circles show the 10 and 20% frequencies.'}
windRose(mydata, type = "year", layout = c(4, 2))
```

The `type` option is very flexible in **openair** and can be used to
quickly consider the dependencies between
variables. Section \@ref(sec:cutData) describes the basis of this option in
**openair** plot. As an example, consider the question: what are the
meteorological conditions that control high and low concentrations of
PM~10~? By setting `type = "pm10"`, **openair** will split the PM~10~
concentrations into four *quantiles* i.e. roughly equal numbers
of points in each level. The plot will then show four different wind
roses for each quantile level, although the default number of levels
can be set by the user --- see `?cutData` for more
details. Figure \@ref(fig:windRsPM10) shows the results of setting
`type = "pm10"`. For the lowest concentrations of PM~10~ the wind
direction is dominated by northerly winds, and relatively low wind
speeds. By contrast, the highest concentrations (plot furthest right)
are dominated by relatively strong winds from the south-west. It is
therefore very easy to obtain a good idea about the conditions that
tend to lead to high (or low) concentrations of a
pollutant. Furthermore, the `type` option is available in almost
all **openair** functions.

```{r windRsPM10,fig.width=10,fig.height=4,fig.cap='Wind rose for four different levels of PM~10~ concentration. The levels are defined as the four *quantiles* of PM~10~ concentration and the ranges are shown on each of the plot labels.'}
windRose(mydata, type = "pm10", layout = c(4, 1))
```

A comparison of the effect that bias has can be seen by plotting the
following. Note the prominent frequencies for W, E and N in particular
that are due to the bias issue discussed by @applequist2012.

```{r windRoseBias, eval=FALSE}
## no bias correction
windRose(mydata, angle = 22.5, bias.corr = FALSE)

## bias correction (the default)
windRose(mydata, angle = 22.5)
```

`pollutionRose` is a variant of `windRose` that is useful for
considering pollutant concentrations by wind direction, or more
specifically the percentage time the concentration is in a particular
range.  This type of approach can be very informative for air
pollutant species, as demonstrated by Ronald Henry and co-authors in @henry2009.

You can produce similar pollution roses using the `pollutionRose`
function in recent versions of **openair**, e.g. as in Figure
\@ref(fig:pollutionrose1):

```{r pollutionrose1,fig.width=5,fig.height=4,out.width='50%',fig.cap='NO~x~ pollution rose produced using  `pollutionRose` and default `pollutionRose` settings.'}
pollutionRose(mydata, pollutant = "nox")
```

`pollutionRose` is *wrapper* for `windRose`. It simply
replaces the wind speed data series in the supplied data set with
another variable using the argument `pollutant` before passing
that on to `windRose`.  It also modifies `breaks` to estimate a
sensible set of break points for that pollutant and uses a slightly
different set of default options (key to right, wedge style plot) but
otherwise handles arguments just like the parent `windRose`
function.

While Figure \@ref(fig:pollutionrose1) indicates that higher NO~x~
concentrations are also associated with the SW, conditioning allows
you to be much informative. For example, conditioning by SO~2~
(Figure \@ref(fig:pollutionrose2) demonstrates that higher NO~x~
concentrations are associated with the SW and much of the higher
SO~2~ concentrations. However, it also highlights a notable NO~x~
contribution from the E, most apparent at highest SO~2~
concentrations that is obscured in Figure \@ref(fig:pollutionrose1) by a
relatively high NO~x~ background (Figure \@ref(fig:pollutionrose2).

```{r pollutionrose2,fig.width=10,fig.height=5,fig.cap='NO~x~ pollution rose conditioned by SO~2~ concentration.'}
pollutionRose(mydata, pollutant = "nox", 
              type = "so2", 
              layout = c(4, 1))
```

`pollutionRose` can also usefully be used to show which wind
directions dominate the overall concentrations. By supplying the
option `statistic = "prop.mean"` (proportion contribution to the
mean), a good idea can be gained as to which wind directions
contribute most to overall concentrations, as well as providing
information on the different concentration levels. A simple plot is
shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pollRoseAttr), which clearly shows the dominance
of south-westerly winds controlling the overall mean NO~x~
concentrations at this site. Indeed, almost half the overall NO~x~
concentration is contributed by two wind sectors to the
south-west. The `polarFreq` function can also show this sort of
information, but the pollution rose is more effective because both
length and colour are used to show the contribution. These plots are
very useful for understanding which wind directions control the
overall mean concentrations.

```{r pollRoseAttr,fig.width=5,h=5,out.width='50%',fig.cap='Pollution rose showing which wind directions contribute mostto overall mean concentrations.'}
pollutionRose(mydata, pollutant = "nox", statistic = "prop.mean")
```
It is sometimes useful to more clearly understand the contributions
from wind directions that have low frequencies. For example, for a
pollution rose of SO~2~ there are few occurrences of easterly winds
making it difficult to see how the concentration intervals are made
up. Try:

```{r pollRoseSO2, eval = FALSE}
pollutionRose(mydata, pollutant = "so2", seg = 1)
``` 

However, each wind sector can be normalised to give a probability
between 0 and 1 to help show the variation within each wind sector
more clearly. An example is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pollutionroseNorm)
where for easterly winds it is now clearer that a greater proportion
of the time the concentration is made up of high SO~2~
concentrations. In this plot each wind sector is scaled between 0 and
1. Also shown with a black like is an indication of the wind direction
frequency to remind us that winds from the east occur with a low
frequency.

```{r pollutionroseNorm,fig.width=5,h=4,out.width='50%',fig.cap='SO~2~ pollution rose produced using `pollutionRose` normalised by each wind sector.'}
pollutionRose(mydata, pollutant = "so2", normalise = TRUE, seg = 1)
```

## Comparing two meteorological data sets {#sec:comp-met}

The `pollutionRose` function is also useful for comparing two
meteorological data sets. In this case a 'reference' data set is
compared with a second data set. There are many reasons for doing so
e.g. to see how one site compares with another or for meteorological
model evaluation (more on that in later sections). In this case,
`ws` and `wd` are considered to the the reference data sets
with which a second set of wind speed and wind directions are to be
compared (`ws2` and `wd2`). The first set of values is
subtracted from the second and the differences compared. If for
example, `wd2` was biased positive compared with `wd` then
`pollutionRose` will show the bias in polar coordinates. In its
default use, wind direction bias is colour-coded to show negative bias
in one colour and positive bias in another.

Note that this plot is mostly aimed at showing wind direction
biases. It does also show the wind speed bias *but only if there
  is a wind direction bias also*. However, in most practical
situations the plot should show both wind speed and direction biases
together. An example of a situation where no wind speed bias would be
shown would be for westerly winds where there was absolutely no bias
between two data sets in terms of westerly wind direction but there
was a difference in wind speed. Users should be aware of this limitation.

In the next example, some artificial wind direction data are generated
by adding a positive bias of 30~degrees with some normally distributed
scatter. Also, the wind speed data are given a positive bias. The
results are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pollRoseComp). The Figure clearly
shows the mean positive bias in wind direction i.e. the direction is
displaced from north (no bias). The colour scale also shows the extent
to which wind speeds are biased i.e. there is a higher proportion of
positively biased wind speeds shown by the red colour compared with the
negatively biased shown in blue. Also shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:pollRoseComp) is the mean wind speed and direction bias
as numerical values.

Note that the `type` option can be used in Figure
\@ref(fig:pollRoseComp) e.g. `type = "month"` to split the
analysis in useful ways. This is useful if one wanted to see whether a
site or the output from a model was biased for different periods. For
example, `type = "daylight"` would show whether there are biases
between nighttime and daytime conditions.


\begin{figure}
```{r pollRoseComp, fig.width=5,fig.height=5,out.width='50%',fig.cap='Pollution rose showing the difference between two  meteorological data sets. The colours are used to show whether data tend to be positively or negatively biased with respect to the reference data set.'}
## $example of comparing 2 met sites
## first we will make some new ws/wd data with a postive bias
mydata <- mutate(mydata,
                    ws2 = ws + 2 * rnorm(nrow(mydata)) + 1,
                    wd2 = wd + 30 * rnorm(nrow(mydata)) + 30)

## need to correct negative wd
id <- which(mydata$wd2 < 0)
mydata$wd2[id] <- mydata$wd2[id] + 360

## results show postive bias in wd and ws
pollutionRose(mydata, 
              ws = "ws", 
              wd = "wd", 
              ws2 = "ws2", 
              wd2 = "wd2", 
              grid.line = 5)
```

An example of using user-supplied breaks is shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:pollRoseComp2). In this case six intervals are chosen
including one that spans -0.5 to +0.5 that is useful to show wind
speeds that do not change.

```{r pollRoseComp2, fig.width=8,fig.height=5,out.width='80%',fig.cap='Pollution rose showing the difference between two meteorological data sets. The colours are used to show whether data tend to be positively or negatively biased with respect to the reference data set. In this case the example shows how to use user-defined breaks and split the data by day/night for a latitude assumed to be London.'}
## add some wd bias to some nighttime hours
id <- which(as.numeric(format(mydata$date, "%H")) %in% c(23, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
mydata$wd2[id] <- mydata$wd[id] + 30 * rnorm(length(id)) + 120
id <- which(mydata$wd2 < 0)
mydata$wd2[id] <- mydata$wd2[id] + 360

pollutionRose(mydata, ws = "ws", wd = "wd", ws2 = "ws2", wd2 = "wd2",
              breaks = c(-11, -2, -1, -0.5, 0.5, 1, 2, 11),
              cols = c("dodgerblue4", "white", "firebrick"),
              grid.line = 5, type = "daylight")
```
