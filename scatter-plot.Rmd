# Scatter plots {#sec:scatterPlot}

## Purpose {#sec:ScatterPurpose}

Scatter plots are extremely useful and a very commonly used analysis
technique for considering how variables relate to one another. R does
of course have many capabilities for plotting data in this
way. However, it can be tricky to add linear relationships, or split
scatter plots by levels of other variables etc. The purpose of the
`scatterPlot` function is to make it straightforward to consider
how variables are related to one another in a way consistent with
other [openair]{.pkg} functions. We have added several capabilities that can
be used just by setting different options, some of which are shown below.

There is less need for this function now that [ggplot2]{.pkg} is available, but it still has some benefits for intercative use.

-  A smooth fit is automatically added to help reveal the
  underlying relationship between two variables together with the
  estimated 95% confidence intervals of the fit. This is in general
  an extremely useful thing to do because it helps to show the
  (possibly) non-linear relationship between variables in a very
  robust way --- or indeed whether the relationship is linear.

-  It is easy to add a linear regression line. The resulting
  equation is shown on the plot together with the R$^2$ value.

-  For large data sets there is the possibility to `bin' the data
  using hexagonal binning or kernel density estimates. This approach
  is very useful when there is considerable over-plotting.

-  It is easy to show how two variables are related to one another
  dependent on levels of a third variable. This capability is very
  useful for exploring how different variables depend on one another
  and can help reveal the underlying important relationships.

-  A plot of two variables can be colour-coded by a continuous
  colour scale of a third variable.

-  It can handle date/time x-axis formats to provide an alternative
  way of showing time series, which again can be colour-coded by a
  third variable.

The `scatterPlot` function isn't really specific to atmospheric
sciences, in the same way as other plots. It is more a function for
convenience, written in a style that is consistent with other [openair]{.pkg}
functions. Nevertheless, along with the `timePlot` function they
do form an important part of [openair]{.pkg} because of the usefulness of
understanding show variables relate to one another. Furthermore, there
are many options to make it easy to explore data in an interactive way
without worrying about processing data or formatting plots.

## Examples {#sec:ScatterEx}

We provide a few examples of use and as usual, users are directed
towards the help pages (type `?scatterPlot`) for more extensive examples.

First we select a subset of data (2003) using the [openair]{.pkg}
`selectByDate` function and plot NO~x~ vs. NO~2~ Figure
(\@ref(fig:scatterPlot1)).

```{r scatterPlot1,fig.width=5,fig.height=5,out.width='50%',fig.cap='Scatter plot of hourly NO~x~ vs. NO~2~ at Marylebone Road for 2003.'}
data2003 <- selectByDate(mydata, year = 2003)
scatterPlot(data2003, x = "nox", y = "no2")
```

Often with several years of data, points are over-plotted and it can
be very difficult to see what the underlying relationship looks
like. One very effective method to use in these situations is to 'bin'
the data and to colour the intervals by the number of counts of
occurrences in each bin. There are various ways of doing this, but
'hexagonal binning' is particularly effective because of the way
hexagons can be placed next to one another.^[In fact it is not
  possible to have a shape with more than 6 sides that can be used to
  forma a lattice without gaps.] To use hexagonal binning it will be
necessary to install the [hexbin]{.pkg} package:

### Hexaganol binning {#sec:hexbin}

Now it should be possible to make the plot by setting the method
option to `method = "hexbin"`, as shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:scatterPlot2). The benefit of hexagonal binning is that
it works equally well with enormous data sets e.g. several million
records. In this case Figure \@ref(fig:scatterPlot2) provides a clearer
indication of the relationship between NO~x~ and NO~2~ than Figure
\@ref(fig:scatterPlot1) because it reveals where most of the points
lie, which is not apparent from Figure \@ref(fig:scatterPlot1). Note that
For `method = "hexbin"` it can be useful to transform the scale if
it is dominated by a few very high values. This is possible by
supplying two functions: one that that applies the transformation and
the other that inverses it. For log scaling for example (the default),
`trans = function(x) log(x)` and `inv = function(x) exp(x)`. For
a square root transform use `trans = sqrt` and `inv =  function(x) x^2`. To not apply any transformation `trans = NULL`
and `inv = NULL` should be used.

```{r scatterPlot2,fig.width=5,fig.height=5,out.width='50%',fig.cap='Scatter plot of hourly NO~x~ vs. NO~2~ at Marylebone Road using hexagonal binning. The number of occurrences in each bin is colour-coded (not on a linear scale). It is now possible to see where most of the data lie and a better indication of the relationship between NO~x~ and NO~2~ is revealed.'}
scatterPlot(data2003, x = "nox", y = "no2", method = "hexbin", col= "jet")
```

Note that when `method = "hexbin"` there are various options that
are useful e.g. a border around each bin and the number of bins. For
example, to place a grey border around each bin and set the bin size
try:

```{r hexbinAlt, eval=FALSE}
scatterPlot(mydata, x = "nox", y = "no2", 
            method = "hexbin", col = "jet",
            border = "grey", xbin = 15)
```

The hexagonal binning and other binning methods are useful but often
the choice of bin size is somewhat arbitrary. Another useful approach
is to use a kernel density estimate to show where most points
lie. This is possible in `scatterPlot` with the `method =
  "density"` option. Such a plot is shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:scatterPlotDens).

```{r scatterPlotDens,fig.width=5,fig.height=4,out.width='55%',fig.cap='Scatter plot of hourly NO~x~ vs. NO~2~ at Marylebone Road using a kernel density estimate to show where most of the points lie. The *intensity* is a measure of how many points lie in a unit area of NO~x~ and NO~2~ concentration.'}
scatterPlot(selectByDate(mydata, year = 2003),
            x = "nox", y = "no2",
            method = "density", 
            cols = "jet")
```

Sometimes it is useful to consider how the relationship between two
variables varies by levels of a third. In [openair]{.pkg} this approach is
possible by setting the option `type`. When `type` is another
numeric variables, four plots are produced for different quantiles of
that variable. We illustrate this point by considering how the
relationship between NO~x~ and NO~2~ varies with different levels of
O~3~. We also take the opportunity to not plot the smooth line, but
plot a linear fit instead and force the layout to be a 2 by 2 grid.

```{r scatterPlot3,fig.width=6,fig.height=6,out.width='65%',fig.cap='Scatter plot of hourly NO~x~ vs. NO~2~ at Marylebone Road by different levels of O~3~.'}
scatterPlot(data2003, x = "nox", y = "no2", 
            type = "o3", smooth = FALSE,
            linear = TRUE, layout = c(2, 2))
```

Below is an extended example that brings together data manipulation, refined plot options and linear fitting of two variables with NO~x~. The aim is to plot the weekly concentration of NO~x~ against PM~10~ and PM~2.5~ and fit linear equations to both relationships. To do this we need the $x$ variable as NO~x~ and the $y$ variable as PM~10~ or PM~2.5~, which means we also need a column that will act as a grouping column i.e. identifies whether the $y$ is PM~10~ or PM~2.5~.

```{r dataManip}
# load the packages we need
library(tidyverse)

# select the variables of interest
subdat <- select(mydata, date, nox, pm10, pm25) # calculate weekly averages
subdat <- timeAverage(subdat, avg.time = "week")

# reshape so we have two variable columns
subdat <- pivot_longer(subdat, cols = c(pm10, pm25), 
                       names_to = "pollutant")
head(subdat)
```

Now we will plot weekly NO~x~ versus PM~10~ and PM~2.5~ and fit a linear equation to both --- and adjust some of the symbols (shown in Figure \@ref(fig:scatterPlotTwo).

```{r scatterPlotTwo,fig.width=6,fig.height=4.5,out.width='67%',fig.cap='Scatter plot of weekly NO~x~ vs. PM~10~ *and* PM~2.5~ at Marylebone Road with linear equations shown and plot symbols modified.'}
scatterPlot(subdat, x = "nox", y = "value", group = "pollutant", 
            pch = 21:22, cex = 1.6, fill = c("dodgerblue", "tomato"), 
            col = "white", 
            linear = TRUE, 
            xlab = "nox (ppb)", 
            ylab = "PM concentration (ug/m3)")
```

To gain a better idea of where the data lie and the linear fits, adding some transparency helps:

```{r scatterPlotTwoAlpha,eval=FALSE}
scatterPlot(subdat, x = "nox", y = "value", 
            group = "variable", 
            pch = 21:22, cex = 1.6, 
            fill = c("dodgerblue", "tomato"), 
            col = "white", 
            linear = TRUE, 
            xlab = "nox (ppb)", 
            ylab = "PM concentration (ug/m3)",
            alpha = 0.2)
```

The above example will also work with `type`. For example, to consider how NO~x~ againts PM~10~ and PM~2.5~ varies by season:

```{r scatterTwoSeas,eval=FALSE}
scatterPlot(subdat, x = "nox", y = "value", 
            group = "variable", 
            pch = 21:22, cex = 2, 
            fill = c("dodgerblue", "tomato"), 
            col = "white", linear = TRUE, 
            xlab = "nox (ppb)", 
            ylab = "PM concentration (ug/m3)", 
            type = "season")
```

Finally, we show how to plot a continuous colour scale for a third
*numeric* variable setting the value of `z` to the third
variable. Figure \@ref(fig:scatterPlot4) shows again the relationship
between NO~x~ and NO~2~ but this time colour-coded by the
concentration of O~3~. We also take the opportunity to split the
data into seasons and weekday/weekend by setting `type =
  c("season", "weekend")`. There is an enormous amount of information
that can be gained from plots such as this. Differences between
weekdays and the weekend can highlight changes in emission sources,
splitting by seasons can show seasonal influences in meteorology and
background O~3~ and colouring the data by the concentration of
O~3~ helps to show how O~3~ concentrations affect NO~2~
concentrations. For example, consider the summertime-weekday panel
where it clearly shows that the higher NO~2~ concentrations are
associated with high O~3~ concentrations. Indeed there are some
hours where NO~2~ is >100 ppb at quite low concentrations of NO~x~
($\approx$ 200 ppb). It would also be interesting instead of using
O~3~ concentrations from Marylebone Road to use O~3~ from a
background site.

Figure \@ref(fig:scatterPlot4) was very easily produced
but contains a huge amount of useful information showing the
relationship between NO~x~ and NO~2~ dependent upon the concentration
of O~3~, the season and the day of the week. There are of course
numerous other plots that are equally easily produced.

```{r scatterPlot4,fig.width=10,fig.height=5,fig.cap='Scatter plot of hourly NO~x~ vs. NO~2~ at Marylebone Road by different levels of O~3~ split by season and weekday-weekend.'}
scatterPlot(data2003, 
            x = "nox", y = "no2", z = "o3", 
            type = c("season", "weekend"),
            limits = c(0, 30))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:scatterPlot5) shows that `scatterPlot` can also
handles dates on the x-axis; in this case shown for SO~2~
concentrations coloured by wind direction for August 2003.

```{r scatterPlot5,fig.width=6,fig.height=4,out.width='65%',fig.cap='Scatter plot of date vs. SO~2~- at Marylebone Road by different levels of wind direction for August 2003.'}
scatterPlot(selectByDate(data2003, month = 8), 
            x = "date", y = "so2",
             z = "wd")
```

Similar to Section \@ref(sec:timePlot), `scatterPlot` can
also plot wind vector arrows if wind speed and wind direction are
available in the data frame. Figure \@ref(fig:scatterPlotwswd) shows an
example of using the `windflow` option. The Figure also sets many
other options including showing the concentration of O~3~ as a
colour, setting the colour scale used and selecting a few days of
interest using the `selectByDate`
function. Figure \@ref(fig:scatterPlotwswd) shows that when the wind
direction changes to northerly, the concentration of NO~2~ decreases
and that of O~3~ increases.

```{r scatterPlotwswd,fig.width=6,fig.height=4,out.width='65%',fig.cap='Scatter plot of date vs. NO~2~ with the colour scale representing O~3~. The wind flow vectors are also shown.'}
scatterPlot(selectByDate(mydata, start = "1/6/2001", 
                         end = "5/6/2001"), 
            x = "date", y = "no2", z = "o3", 
            col = "increment", 
            windflow = list(scale = 0.15), 
            key.footer = "o3\n (ppb)", 
            main = NULL, ylab = "no2 (ppb)")
```
