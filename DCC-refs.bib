  abstract =	 { Diesel-powered road vehicles are important sources
                  for nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and the European
                  passenger fleet is highly dieselised, which has
                  resulted in many European roadside environments
                  being non-compliant with legal air quality standards
                  for nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Based on vehicle
                  emission remote sensing data for 300 000 light-duty
                  vehicles across the United Kingdom, light-duty
                  diesel NOx emissions were found to be highly
                  dependent on ambient temperature with low
                  temperatures resulting in higher NOx emissions,
                  i.e., a "low temperature NOx emission penalty" was
                  identified. This feature was not observed for
                  gasoline-powered vehicles. Older Euro 3 to 5 diesel
                  vehicles emitted NOx similarly, but vehicles
                  compliant with the latest Euro 6 emission standard,
                  emitted less NOx than older vehicles and
                  demonstrated less of an ambient temperature
                  dependence. This ambient temperature dependence is
                  overlooked in current emission inventories, but is
                  of importance from an air quality perspective. Owing
                  to Europe's climate, a predicted average of 38 \%
                  more NOx emissions have burdened Europe when
                  compared to temperatures encountered in laboratory
                  test cycles. However, owing to the progressive
                  elimination of vehicles demonstrating the most
                  severe low temperature NOx penalty, light-duty
                  diesel NOx emissions are likely to decrease more
                  rapidly throughout Europe than currently thought. },

  abstract =	 {The direct emission of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from
                  road vehicle exhaust has been an important
                  contributor to near-road ambient concentrations of
                  NO2 in many European cities. Diesel vehicles and
                  their use of emission control technologies such as
                  Diesel Oxidation Catalysts, have dominated the
                  emission of NO2 from road vehicles. In this work, we
                  summarise findings from recent vehicle emission
                  remote sensing measurements in the UK that provide
                  detailed information on the emissions of NO2 and
                  total NOx(NO2+NO). We show that while new
                  diesel cars and light commercial vehicles are
                  associated with high (typically 30{\%}) proportions
                  of NO2/NOx, the amount of absolute NOx and NO2
                  emitted by most Euro 6 vehicles has decreased
                  substantially and that absolute emissions of NO2
                  have been reducing since around 2007. Additionally,
                  we find that the amount of NO2 decreases as the
                  vehicle mileage increases. Taken together, these
                  factors have led to substantial reductions in
                  emissions of NO2 in recent years from light duty
                  diesel vehicles, which has contributed to reduced
                  roadside NO2 concentrations. There is a need however
                  for commonly used emission factor models to account
                  for these changes in emissions of NO2.},

In this work, a trend analysis of pollutants involved in NO2 processes was done for the period 2003–2014 in traffic sites from three Spanish cities (Barcelona, Madrid and Granada) that still exceed the European NO2 air quality standard limits. We also estimated the contributions of primary NO2 emissions and photo-chemically formed NO2 to the observed ambient NO2 concentrations in order to explore their possible role in the observed NO2 concentration trends. The NOx and NO concentrations at these traffic sites showed significant decreasing trends during the period 2003–2014, especially at Barcelona (BARTR) and Madrid (MADTR) traffic stations. The NO2 concentrations showed statistically significant downward trends at BARTR and MADTR and remained unchanged at Granada traffic station (GRATR) during the study period. Despite the significant decrease in NO2 concentrations in BCNTR and MADTR during the analysed period, the NO2 concentrations observed over these sites still above the annual NO2 standard limit of 40 $\mu$g m−3 and, therefore, more efficient measures are still needed. Primary NO2 emissions significantly influence NO2 concentrations at the three analysed sites. However, as no drastic changes are expected in the after-exhaust treatment technology that can reduce primary NO2 emissions to zero in the near future, only a substantial reduction in NOx emissions will help to comply with the NO2 European air quality standards. Reduction of 78{\%}, 56{\%} and 16{\%} on NOx emissions in Barcelona, Madrid and Granada were estimated to be necessary to comply with the NO2 annual limit of 40 $\mu$g m−3.},

Abstract = {{In this study CO2 and NOx emissions from 149 Euro 5 and 6 diesel,
   gasoline and hybrid passenger cars were compared using a Portable
   Emissions Measurement System (PEMS). The models sampled accounted for
   56\% of all passenger cars sold in Europe in 2016. We found gasoline
   vehicles had CO2 emissions 13-66\% higher than diesel. During urban
   driving, the average CO2 emission factor was 210.5 (sd. 47) g km(-1) for
   gasoline and 170.2 (sd. 34) g km(-1) for diesel. Half the gasoline
   vehicles tested were Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI). Euro 6 GDI engines
   < 1.4l delivered similar to 17\% CO2 reduction compared to Port Fuel
   Injection (PFI). Gasoline vehicles delivered an 8696\% reduction in NOx
   emissions compared to diesel cars. The average urban NOx emission from
   Euro 6 diesel vehicles 0.44 (sd. 0.44) g km(-1) was 11 times higher than
   for gasoline 0.04 (sd. 0.04) g km(-1). We also analysed two
   gasoline-electric hybrids which out-performed both gasoline and diesel
   for NOx and CO2. We conclude action is required to mitigate the public
   health risk created by excessive NOx emissions from modern diesel
   vehicles. Replacing diesel with gasoline would incur a substantial CO2
   penalty, however greater uptake of hybrid vehicles would likely reduce
   both CO2 and NOx emissions. Discrimination of vehicles on the basis of
   Euro standard is arbitrary and incentives should promote vehicles with
   the lowest real-world emissions of both NOx and CO2. (C) 2017 Elsevier

  abstract = {Residents of large European cities are exposed to NO2 concentrations that often exceed the established air quality standards. Diesel cars have been identified as a major contributor to this situation; yet, it remains unclear to which levels the NOXemissions of diesel cars have to decrease to effectively mitigate urban NO2pollution across Europe. Here, we take a continental perspective and model urban NO2pollution in a generic street canyon of 8 major European cities for various NOXemission scenarios. We find that a reduction in the on-road NOXemissions of diesel cars to the Euro 6 level can in general decrease the regional and urban NO2concentrations and thereby the frequency of exceedances of the NO2air quality standard. High NO2fractions in the NOXemissions of diesel cars tend to increase the urban NO2concentrations only in proximity of intense road traffic typically found on artery roads in large cities like Paris and London. In cities with a low share of diesel cars in the vehicle fleet such as Athens or a high contribution from the NO2background to the urban NO2pollution such as Krakow, measures addressing heavy-duty vehicles, and the manufacturing, energy, and mining industry are necessary to decrease urban air pollution. We regard our model results as robust albeit subject to uncertainty resulting from the application of a generic street layout. With small modifications in the input parameters, our model could be used to assess the impact of NOXemissions from road transport on NO2air pollution in any European city.},

@article{Carslaw2016,
abstract = {Reducing ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) remains a key challenge across many European urban areas, particularly close to roads. This challenge mostly relates to the lack of reduction in emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from diesel road vehicles relative to the reductions expected through increasingly stringent vehicle emissions legislation. However, a key component of near-road concentrations of NO2 derives from directly emitted (primary) NO2 from diesel vehicles. It is well-established that the proportion of NO2 (i.e. the NO2/NOx ratio) in vehicle exhaust has increased over the past decade as a result of vehicle after-treatment technologies that oxidise carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and generate NO2 to aid the emissions control of diesel particulate. In this work we bring together an analysis of ambient NOx and NO2 measurements with comprehensive vehicle emission remote sensing data obtained in London to better understand recent trends in the NO2/NOx ratio from road vehicles. We show that there is evidence that NO2 concentrations have decreased since around 2010 despite less evidence of a reduction in total NOx. The decrease is shown to be driven by relatively large reductions in the amount of NO2 directly emitted by vehicles; from around 25 vol{\%} in 2010 to 15 vol{\%} in 2014 in inner London, for example. The analysis of NOx and NO2 vehicle emission remote sensing data shows that these reductions have been mostly driven by reduced NO2/NOx emission ratios from heavy duty vehicles and buses rather than light duty vehicles. However, there is also evidence from the analysis of Euro 4 and 5 diesel passenger cars that as vehicles age the NO2/NOx ratio decreases. For example the NO2/NOx ratio decreased from 29.5 ± 2.0{\%} in Euro 5 diesel cars up to one year old to 22.7 ± 2.5{\%} for four-year old vehicles. At some roadside locations the reductions in primary NO2 have had a large effect on reducing both the annual mean and number of hourly exceedances of the European Limit Values of NO2.},

                  addresses hydrocarbons and CO vehicular

                  impact that cold ambient temperatures have on Euro 6
                  diesel and spark ignition (including: gasoline,

                  degrees C the tested vehicles present emissions
                  below the values set for type approval of Euro 6
                  vehicles (still using NEDC), with the exception of
                  NOx emissions from diesel vehicles that were 2.3-6
                  times higher than Euro 6 standards. However,
                  emissions disproportionally increased when vehicles
                  were tested at cold ambient temperature (-7 degrees
                  C). High solid particle number (SPN) emissions (>1 x
                  10(11) \# km(-1)) were measured from gasoline direct
                  injection (GDI) vehicles and gasoline port fuel
                  injection vehicles. However, only diesel and GDI SPN
                  emissions are currently regulated. Results show the
                  need for a new, technology independent, procedure
                  that enables the authorities to assess pollutant
                  emissions from vehicles at cold ambient
                  temperatures.  Harmful pollutant emissions from

                  the same season, and virtually the same instrument
                  is unique, probably worldwide.  We analyze the
                  development of unit exhaust emissions from model
                  years 1985 until 2012, covering all five Euro
                  emission limit stages in force.  NOx emissions from
                  both diesel cars and light commercial vehicles have
                  actually increased in real-driving over time
                  although emission limits have been progressively
                  tightened. This behavior is explained mostly by a
                  significant discrepancy between engine conditions
                  during real-driving and the homologation test
                  procedure. This discrepancy is not important for the
                  other pollutants or for gasoline light duty
                  vehicles, for which the emission control equipment
                  is found working over a wide range of engine
                  conditions. Our results confirm emission factors
                  from the latest HBEFA model when deterioration and
                  engine load are accounted for. Recent remote sensing
                  measurements of diesel cars and light commercial
                  vehicles in London are at the same or higher
                  levels. However, given that engine load is much
                  lower in London, this coincidence is rather
                  puzzling. A key uncertainty is the amount of primary
                  NO2 in the exhaust, and potential systematic
                  differences between dominant brands in European
                  countries.  Both needs further investigation. (C)

  Abstract =	 {{Direct measurements of NOx concentration and flux
                  were made from a tall tower in central London, UK as
                  part of the Clean Air for London (ClearfLo)
                  project. Fast time resolution (10 Hz) NO and NO2
                  concentrations were measured and combined with fast
                  vertical wind measurements to provide top-down flux
                  estimates using the eddy covariance
                  technique. Measured NOx fluxes were usually positive
                  and ranged from close to zero at night to 2000-8000
                  ng m(-2) s(-1) during the day. Peak fluxes were
                  usually observed in the morning, coincident with the
                  maximum traffic flow. Measurements of the NOx flux
                  have been scaled and compared to the UK National
                  Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) estimate of
                  NOx emission for the measurement footprint. The
                  measurements are on average 80\% higher than the
                  NAEI emission inventory for all of
                  London. Observations made in westerly airflow (from
                  parts of London where traffic is a smaller fraction
                  of the NOx source) showed a better agreement on
                  average with the inventory. The observations suggest
                  that the emissions inventory is poorest at
                  estimating NOx when traffic is the dominant source,
                  in this case from an easterly direction from the BT
                  Tower. Agreement between the measurements and the
                  London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI) are
                  better, due to the more explicit treatment of
                  traffic flow by this more detailed inventory. The
                  flux observations support previous tailpipe
                  observations of higher NOx emitted from the London
                  vehicle diesel fleet than is represented in the NAEI
                  or predicted for several EURO emission control
                  technologies.  Higher-than-anticipated vehicle NOx
                  is likely responsible for the significant
                  discrepancies that exist in London between observed
                  NOx and long-term NOx projections.}},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper uses registration and
                  enforcement information to assess the impact of
                  London’s low emission zone on vehicle registrations,
                  usage and air pollution. The zone was implemented in
                  a staged process in 2008 to reduce the emissions of
                  air pollutants of direct harm to human health. The
                  zone targeted the worst polluters, specifically
                  heavy diesel vehicles, buses and coaches by imposing
                  minimum emissions standards on vehicles operating in
                  an area covering most of Greater London. Several
                  years on it remains unclear how successful the zone
                  has been in meeting its stated objectives and what
                  improvements in pollution levels can be attributed
                  to the low emission zone. Results presented in this
                  paper suggest the rate of fleet turnover for
                  affected vehicle classes in London increased
                  substantially when the zone was first introduced
                  before returning to the national average in
                  subsequent years. Early evidence for light
                  commercial vehicles, which became subject to the
                  scheme in early 2012, shows a similar effect is
                  likely. Despite an overall growth in freight
                  vehicles operating in London, the number of pre-Euro
                  \{III\} vehicles has dropped and this has been
                  coupled with a switch from rigid vehicles to light
                  commercial vehicles and articulated
                  vehicles. Ambient air quality measurements show
                  concentrations of particulate matter within the low
                  emission zone have dropped by 2.46–3.07% compared to
                  just over 1% for areas just outside the
                  zone. However, no discernible differences are found
                  for \{NOX\} concentrations. },

                  issues periodic reports that describe air quality
                  trends in the US. For some pollutants, such as
                  ozone, both observed and meteorologically adjusted
                  trends are displayed. This paper describes an
                  improved statistical methodology for
                  meteorologically adjusting ozone trends as well as
                  characterizes the relationships between individual
                  meteorological parameters and ozone. A generalized
                  linear model that accommodates the nonlinear effects
                  of the meteorological variables was fit to data
                  collected for 39 major eastern US urban
                  areas. Overall, the model performs very well,
                  yielding R-2 Statistics as high as 0.80. The
                  analysis confirms that ozone is generally increasing
                  with increasing temperature and decreasing with
                  increasing relative humidity. Examination of the
                  spatial gradients of these responses show that the
                  effect of temperature on ozone is most pronounced in
                  the north while the opposite is true of relative
                  humidity.  By including HYSPLIT-derived transport
                  wind direction and distance in the model, it is
                  shown that the largest incremental impact of wind
                  direction on ozone occurs along the periphery of the

                  diameter of 10 mu m or less (PM10) and
                  meteorological observations are available from 13
                  stations distributed throughout Switzerland and
                  representing different site types. The effect of all
                  available meteorological variables on PM10
                  concentrations was estimated using Generalized
                  Additive Models. Data from each season were treated
                  separately. The most important variables affecting
                  PM10 concentrations in winter, autumn and spring
                  were wind gust, the precipitation rate of the
                  previous day, the precipitation rate of the current
                  day and the boundary layer depth. In summer, the
                  most important variables were wind gust, Julian day
                  and afternoon temperature. In addition, temperature
                  was important in winter. A ``weekend effect{''} was
                  identified due to the selection of variable ``day of
                  the week{''} for some stations. Thursday contributes
                  to an increase of 13\% whereas Sunday contributes to
                  a reduction of 12\% of PM10 concentrations compared
                  to Monday on average over 9 stations for the yearly
                  data. The estimated effects of meteorological
                  variables were removed from the measured PM10 values
                  to obtain the PM10 variability and trends due to
                  other factors and processes, mainly PM10 emissions
                  and formation of secondary PM10 due to trace gas
                  emissions. After applying this process, the PM10
                  variability was much lower, especially in winter
                  where the ratio of adjusted over measured mean
                  squared error was 0.27 on average over all
                  considered sites. Moreover, PM10 trends in winter
                  were more negative after the adjustment for
                  meteorology and they ranged between -1.25 mu g m(-3)
                  yr(-1) and 0.07 mu g m(-3) yr(-1). The adjusted
                  trends for the other seasons ranged between -1.34 mu
                  g m(-3) yr(-1) and -0.26 mu g m(-3) yr(-1) in
                  spring, -1.40 mu g m(-3) yr(-1) and -0.28 mu g m(-3)
                  yr(-1) in summer and -1.28 mu g m(-3) yr(-1) and
                  -0.11 mu g m(-3) yr(-1) in autumn. The estimated
                  trends of meteorologically adjusted PM10 were in
                  general non-linear. The two urban street sites
                  considered in the study, Bern and Lausanne,
                  experienced the largest reduction in measured and
                  adjusted PM10 concentrations. This indicates a
                  verifiable effect of traffic emission reduction
                  strategies implemented during the past two
                  decades. The average adjusted yearly trends for
                  rural, urban background and urban street stations
                  were -0.37, -0.53 and -1.2 mu g m(-3) yr(-1)
                  respectively. The adjusted yearly trends for all
                  stations range from -0.15 mu g m(-3) yr(-1) to -1.2
                  mu g m(-3) yr(-1) or -1.2\% yr(-1) to -3.3\%
                  yr(-1).}},

                  as efficient as possible when monitoring air
                  pollution data, there is still an indisputable need
                  for statistical post processing (quality
                  assessment). We examined data on tropospheric ozone
                  and found that meteorological normalisation can
                  reveal (i) errors that have not been eliminated by
                  established procedures for quality assurance and
                  control of collected data, as well as (ii)
                  inaccuracies that may have a detrimental effect on
                  the results of statistical tests for temporal
                  trends. Moreover, we observed that the quality
                  assessment of collected data could be further
                  strengthened by combining meteorological
                  normalisation with non-parametric smoothing
                  techniques for seasonal adjustment and detection of
                  sudden shifts in level. Closer examination of
                  apparent trends in tropospheric ozone records from
                  EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme)
                  sites in Finland showed that, even if potential raw
                  data errors were taken into account, there was
                  strong evidence of upward trends during winter and

                  the UK and the EU (15) by 71\% and 72\%,
                  respectively, between 1986 and 2001, while nitrous
                  oxide emissions declined by about 40\%. Acidity in
                  UK precipitation and the deposition of sulphate in
                  precipitation halved during this period, but
                  reductions were larger in the English Midlands than
                  at the west coast and in high rainfall areas (> 2000
                  mm). There is evidence that the smaller reductions
                  in sulphur deposition in the west and south are due
                  in part to shipping sources of SO2. Reductions in
                  sulphur dry deposition (74\%) are larger than in wet
                  deposition (45\%), due to changes in the canopy

                  there has been a small (10\%) reduction in emissions

                  SO2 the EFs of the total vehicle fleet decreased

                  51\%, 5\%, 71\%, and 55\%, respectively. The much
                  smaller negative trend of NO2 compared to NO,
                  indicates that the NO2/NOx road traffic emissions
                  ratio increased during this period (from 14\% in
                  1992 to 23\% in 2004). It is shown that this trend
                  is caused by increasing primary NO2 road traffic
                  emissions rather than by increasing secondary NO2
                  formation via reaction of NO with O-3.  Data for

  Abstract =	 {{An assessment of the formation of NO2
                  concentrations in heavily traffic-influenced
                  environments in Helsinki, Finland was carried out.
                  The proportion of primary NO2 emissions from road
                  traffic was estimated using a statistical model for
                  the relationship between the mixing ratios of
                  nitrogen oxides (NO + NO2) and total oxidant (O-3 +
                  NO2) measured in 1994-2009. Based on this analysis,
                  a quantitative estimate was derived for the relative
                  importance of the primary NO2 emissions, ambient
                  NO-NO2-O-3 equilibrium and background concentrations
                  in the observed NO2 concentrations. The proportion
                  of primary NO2 in the vehicular NOx emissions
                  increased from below 10\% in the 1990s to about 20\%
                  in 2009, with a more distinctive increase during the
                  most recent years. This development was related to
                  the changes in the proportion of diesel-powered
                  passenger cars in Finland. Between 1994 and 2004,
                  the photochemical NO-to-NO2 conversion comprised on
                  average 51\% of the mean NO2 concentration, while
                  the primary NO2 emissions contributed 31\%. The role
                  of the primary NO2 emissions was limited by the
                  steeply-decreasing total NOx emissions. More recent
                  data (2005-2009) yielded higher primary NO2 emission
                  fractions (15-21\%), with a clearly increasing
                  trend. As a result, the contribution of chemical
                  conversion steadily decreased from 54\% in 2005 to
                  43\% in 2009, while that of the primary NO2
                  emissions increased from 32 to 44\%. In order not to
                  exceed in future the annual limit of NO2
                  concentration, set by the European Union, in the
                  busiest street canyons in downtown Helsinki, the
                  primary NO2 emissions need to be addressed alongside
                  the total NOx emissions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.  All

                  exhaust emissions of a sample of over fifty thousand
                  road vehicles operating in London were measured
                  using roadside remote sensing absorption
                  spectroscopy techniques (infrared and ultraviolet),
                  combined with Automatic Number Plate Recognition for
                  vehicle identification. Levels of carbon monoxide
                  (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitric oxide (NO), and
                  smoke (particulate) exhaust emissions are reported
                  by vehicle class, fuel type, and Euro emissions
                  standard. Emissions from petrol cars of each
                  pollutant were all observed to display a
                  statistically significant reduction with the
                  introduction of each successive Euro emissions
                  standard from Euro 1 onwards. However, Euro 2 diesel
                  cars were observed to emit statistically higher
                  rates of NO than either Euro 1 or Euro 3 standard
                  diesel cars. The study also confirms the continuing
                  `dieselisation' of the UK passenger car fleet. Mean
                  NO emissions from Euro 4 diesel cars were found to
                  be 6 times higher than Euro 4 petrol cars,
                  highlighting the need to develop a sound
                  understanding of the current and future `in-use'
                  emissions characteristics of diesel vehicles, and
                  their influence on local air quality. Smoke
                  emissions from TXII London taxis (black cabs) were
                  found to be statistically higher than either earlier
                  TX1 or later TX4 model variants, with possible
                  implications for local air quality policy

                  sensing data set collected in 2008 is used to define
                  the dynamic relationship between vehicle specific
                  power and exhaust emissions, across a range of
                  vehicle ages, engine capacities, and fuel types. The
                  New European Driving Cycle is synthesized from the
                  remote sensing data using vehicle specific power to
                  characterize engine load, and the results compared
                  with official published emissions data from vehicle
                  type approval tests over the same driving
                  cycle. Mean carbon monoxide emissions from
                  gasoline-powered cars <= 3 years old measured using
                  remote sensing are found to be 1.3 times higher than
                  published original type approval test values; this
                  factor increases to 2.2 for cars 4-8 years old, and
                  6.4 for cars 9-12 years old. The corresponding
                  factors for diesel cars are 1.1, 1.4, and 1.2,

  Abstract =	 {{In this paper we use a quantile regression
                  technique to explore the emissions characteristics
                  of petrol and diesel passenger cars to reveal the
                  importance of high vehicle power on exhaust
                  emissions. A large database of approximate to 67,000
                  passenger cars from vehicle emission remote sensing
                  data was used from surveys from several campaigns
                  around the UK. Most previous remote sensing studies
                  have focused on presenting mean emission estimates
                  by vehicle type over time. However, as shown in the
                  current work, considerably more insight can be
                  gained into vehicle emission characteristics if
                  techniques are used that can describe and model the
                  full distribution of vehicle emissions as a function
                  of important explanatory variables. For post-2000
                  model year (Euro 3-5) diesel cars it is shown that
                  there is a strong dependence of vehicle specific
                  power for emissions of NOx that was absent in
                  earlier models and is absent for other pollutants
                  such as CO, hydrocarbons and `smoke'.  Furthermore,
                  we also find a stronger dependence on vehicle
                  specific power for older catalyst-equipped petrol
                  vehicles (Euro 1/2) on emissions of NOx that is less
                  important for other emissions such as CO and
                  hydrocarbons. Moreover, it is shown that while the
                  rated maximum power output of petrol cars has
                  remained almost constant over the past 15-20 years,
                  the power output from diesel cars has increased
                  markedly by about 50\%. These results suggest that
                  changes to vehicle technology, driving conditions
                  and driver behaviour have become more important
                  determinants of passenger car NOx emissions in
                  recent years and may help explain why urban ambient
                  concentrations of NOx have not decreased as much as
                  anticipated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  Abstract =	 {{In this paper we have compared detailed road
                  traffic NOx emissions with the equivalent trends in
                  ambient roadside NOx measurements. This was
                  undertaken separately in Great Britain and London,
                  for all of the major roads, and by road type and
                  location. The emissions trends were created using
                  different emissions factors, those used in UK
                  emissions inventories (Base case), the Swiss-German
                  handbook (HBEFA), and those created from recent
                  remote sensing measurements in the UK (RSD). An
                  alternative assumption for use of Selective
                  Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in the articulated Heavy
                  Goods Vehicle (HGV) fleet was also tested. For all
                  scenarios traffic flows, speeds and vehicle age were
                  kept constant.  Comparison between the emissions
                  scenarios in Great Britain showed that by 2009, NOx
                  emissions estimates from road traffic could be as
                  much as 25\% greater than current UK estimates and
                  31\% greater in London. The RSD emissions inventory
                  gave the smallest downward trend in NOx emissions,
                  from 2004 to 2009, of between 3 and 4\%/year and
                  this compared with a reduction of similar to
                  6\%/year from the Base Case and HBEFA scenarios. All
                  scenarios compared poorly with roadside NOx
                  measurement trends from UK sites, which typically
                  reduce by between 1\% and 2\%/year. We have shown
                  that the differences in NOx emissions trends were
                  driven, partially at least, by the relative
                  contribution from light duty diesel vehicles. An
                  analysis from 2700 NOx measurement sites throughout
                  Europe has shown that this problem is unlikely to be
                  limited to the UK, and identifies a difficulty in
                  meeting EU limit values for NO2, obligations under
                  the National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD,
                  2001) and the Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE, 1999) and

                  fully consistent with the meteorological component;
                  both components use the same transport scheme (mass
                  and scalar preserving), the same grid (horizontal
                  and vertical components), and the same physics
                  schemes for subgrid-scale transport. The components
                  also use the same timestep, hence no temporal
                  interpolation is needed. The chemistry package

                  scheme coupled with hydrometeors), and a state of
                  the art aerosol module (MADE/SORGAM aerosol
                  parameterization).  The WRF/Chem model is
                  statistically evaluated and compared to MM5/Chem and
                  to detailed photochemical data collected during the
                  summer 2002 NEAQS field study. It is shown that the
                  WRF/Chern model is statistically better skilled in
                  forecasting O-3 than MM5/Chem, with no appreciable
                  differences between models in terms of bias with the
                  observations.  Furthermore, the WRF/Chent model
                  consistently exhibits better skill at forecasting
                  the O-3 precursors CO and NOy at all of the surface
                  sites.  However, the WRF/Chern model biases of these
                  precursors and of other gas-phase species are
                  persistently higher than for MM5/Chem, and are most
                  often biased high compared to observations. Finally,
                  we show that the impact of other basic model
                  assumptions on these same statistics can be much
                  larger than the differences caused by model
                  differences. An example showing the sensitivity of
                  various statistical measures with respect to the
                  treatment of biogenic volatile organic compounds

  Abstract =	 {{The CMAQ modeling system has been used to simulate
                  the air quality for North America and Europe for the
                  entire year of 2006 as part of the Air Quality Model
                  Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII). The
                  operational model performance of tropospheric ozone
                  (O-3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and total
                  particulate matter (PM10) for the two continents has
                  been assessed. The model underestimates daytime
                  (8am-8pm LST) O-3 mixing ratios by 13\% in the
                  winter for North America, primarily due to an
                  underestimation of daytime O-3 mixing ratios in the
                  middle and lower troposphere from the lateral
                  boundary conditions. The model overestimates winter
                  daytime O-3 mixing ratios in Europe by an average of
                  8.4\%. The model underestimates daytime O-3 by 4-5\%
                  in the spring for both continents, while in the
                  summer daytime O-3 is overestimated by 9.8\% for
                  North America and slightly underestimated by 1.6\%
                  for Europe. The model overestimates daytime O-3 in
                  the fall for both continents, grossly overestimating
                  daytime O-3 by over 30\% for Europe. The performance
                  for PM2.5 varies both seasonally and geographically
                  for the two continents. For North American, PM2.5 is
                  overestimated in the winter and fall, with an
                  average Normalized Mean Bias (NMB) greater than
                  30\%, while performance in the summer is relatively
                  good, with an average NMB of -4.6\%. For Europe,
                  PM2.5 is underestimated throughout the entire year,
                  with the NMB ranging from -24\% in the fall to -55\%
                  in the winter. PM10 is underestimated throughout the
                  year for both North America and Europe, with
                  remarkably similar performance for both
                  continents. The domain average NMB for PK10 ranges
                  between -45\% and -65\% for the two continents, with
                  the largest underestimation occurring in the summer
                  for North American and the winter for
                  Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

  Abstract =	 {{The Ozone Source Receptor Model (OSRM) is a
                  Lagrangian trajectory model developed to describe
                  photochemical ozone production in the UK. The OSRM
                  builds on existing boundary layer trajectory models
                  used previously for assisting the development of UK
                  ozone policy, but has a number of notable
                  differences. A novel feature of the OSRM is a
                  surface conversion module to represent the vertical
                  gradient in ozone arising from chemical loss and
                  deposition to the surface. This has significantly
                  improved the performance of the model, especially in
                  urban areas. In this paper, the modelling system is
                  described and its performance against measured ozone
                  concentrations and metrics and other UK ozone models
                  is discussed. The model has been used to calculate
                  future ozone concentrations in the UK and thus to
                  assess a number of possible control measures

  Abstract =	 {{Unusually high levels of PM(10) were observed in
                  the UK in May 2006 and September 2002. This paper
                  investigates the possible contribution of long-range
                  transport of smoke from widespread agricultural
                  burning and forest fires in western Russia to these
                  air Pollution episodes. The Lagrangian dispersion
                  model NAME is run in both forwards and backwards
                  modes to determine the transport and sources of the
                  polluted air masses for the two
                  incidents. Comparison of the model results to
                  satellite data and ground observations from across
                  Europe demonstrates good agreement for both the
                  timing and magnitude of the episodes and suggests
                  that fires in western Russia were the primary cause
                  of both incidents.  Secondary contributions to the
                  2006 episode may have come from European
                  anthropogenic pollution and pollen released in
                  northern Europe. The occurrence and timing of both
                  pollution episodes were strongly controlled by the
                  meteorological situation at the time. Scaling of
                  model results to observations suggests that 0.5-0.7
                  Mtonnes of biomass per day could have been burnt
                  during periods when winds reaching the UK were from
                  the east. The newly reported 2006 episode means that
                  Russian fires have affected UK air quality at least
                  twice since 2000 and it is suggested that, without
                  changes in current practice, such events are likely
                  to occur again in the future with implications for
                  UK and European air quality. Crown Copyright (c)

                  mass concentrations in Helsinki over the 12 days
                  period in April and May 2006. To characterize
                  aerosols during this period, the real-time
                  measurements were done for PM2.5, PM2.5-10, common
                  ions and black carbon. Moreover, the 24-h PM1 filter
                  samples were analysed for organic and elemental
                  carbon (OC and EC), water-soluble organic carbon
                  (WSOC), ions and levoglucosan. The Finnish emergency
                  and air quality modelling system SILAM was used for
                  the forecast of the PM2.5 concentration generated by
                  biomass burning. According to the real-time PM2.5
                  data, the investigated period was divided into four
                  types of PM situations: episode 1 (EPI-1; 25-29
                  April), episode 2 (EPI-2; 1-5 May), episode 3
                  (EPI-3; 5-6 May) and a reference period (REF; 24
                  March-24 April). EPI-3 included a local warehouse
                  fire and therefore it is discussed separately. The
                  PM I mass concentrations of biomass burning
                  tracers-levoglucosan, potassium and
                  oxalate-increased during the two long-range
                  transport episodes (EPI-1 and EPI-2). The most
                  substantial difference between the episodes was
                  exhibited by the sulphate concentration, which was
                  4.9 (+/- 1.4) mu g m(-3) in EPI-2 but only 2.4 (+/-
                  0.31) mu g m(-3) in EPI-1 being close to that of REF
                  (1.8 +/- 0.54 mu g m(-3)). The concentration of
                  particulate organic matter in PM1 was clearly higher
                  during EPI-1 (11 +/- 3.3 mu g m(-3)) and EPI-2 (9.7
                  +/- 4.0 mu g m(-3)) than REF (1.3 +/- 0.45 mu g
                  m(-3)). The long-range transported smoke had only a
                  minor impact on the WSOC-to-OC ratio. According to
                  the model simulations, MODIS detected the fires that
                  caused the first set of concentration peaks (EPI-1)
                  and the local warehouse fire (EPI-3), but missed the
                  second one (EPI-2) probably due to dense frontal
                  clouds. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  abstract = {More than ten state-of-the-art regional air quality
                  models have been applied as part of the Air Quality
                  Model Evaluation International Initiative
                  (AQMEII). These models were run by twenty
                  independent groups in Europe and North
                  America. Standardised modelling outputs over a full
                  year (2006) from each group have been shared on the
                  web-distributed ENSEMBLE system, which allows for
                  statistical and ensemble analyses to be performed by
                  each group. The estimated ground-level ozone mixing
                  ratios from the models are collectively examined in
                  an ensemble fashion and evaluated against a large
                  set of observations from both continents. The scale
                  of the exercise is unprecedented and offers a unique
                  opportunity to investigate methodologies for
                  generating skilful ensembles of regional air quality
                  models outputs. Despite the remarkable progress of
                  ensemble air quality modelling over the past decade,
                  there are still outstanding questions regarding this
                  technique. Among them, what is the best and most
                  beneficial way to build an ensemble of members? And
                  how should the optimum size of the ensemble be
                  determined in order to capture data variability as
                  well as keeping the error low? These questions are
                  addressed here by looking at optimal ensemble size
                  and quality of the members. The analysis carried out
                  is based on systematic minimization of the model
                  error and is important for performing
                  diagnostic/probabilistic model evaluation. It is
                  shown that the most commonly used multi-model
                  approach, namely the average over all available
                  members, can be outperformed by subsets of members
                  optimally selected in terms of bias, error, and
                  correlation. More importantly, this result does not
                  strictly depend on the skill of the individual
                  members, but may require the inclusion of
                  low-ranking skill-score members. A clustering
                  methodology is applied to discern among members and
                  to build a skilful ensemble based on model
                  association and data clustering, which makes no use
                  of priori knowledge of model skill. Results show
                  that, while the methodology needs further
                  refinement, by optimally selecting the cluster
                  distance and association criteria, this approach can
                  be useful for model applications beyond those
                  strictly related to model evaluation, such as air
                  quality forecasting.},

                  subject of a number of recent studies due to their
                  potential impact on ambient particulate matter
                  (PM). Highly time-resolved NH3 emissions can be
                  measured and correlated with specific driving events
                  utilizing a tunable diode laser (TDL). It is
                  possible to incorporate NH3 emissions with this new
                  information into models that can be used to predict
                  emissions inventories from vehicles. The newer
                  generation of modal models are based on modal
                  events, with the data collected at second-by-second
                  time resolution, unlike the bag-based emission
                  inventory models such as EMFAC and MOBILE. The
                  development of an NH3 modal model is described in
                  this paper. This represents one of the first
                  attempts to incorporate vehicle NH3 emissions into a
                  comprehensive emissions model. This model was used
                  in conjunction with on-road driving profiles to
                  estimate the emissions of SULEV, ULEV, and LEV
                  vehicles to be 9.4 +/- 4.1, 21.8 +/- 5.2, and 34.9
                  +/- 6.0 mg/mi, respectively. We also implement this
                  new NH3 model to predict and evaluate the NH3

                  light-duty vehicles have to comply with emission
                  limits during standardized laboratory emissions
                  testing. Although emission limits have become more
                  stringent in past decades, light-duty vehicles
                  remain an important source of nitrogen oxides and
                  carbon monoxide emissions in Europe. Furthermore,
                  persisting air quality problems in many urban areas
                  suggest that laboratory emissions testing may not
                  accurately capture the on road emissions of light
                  duty vehicles. To address this issue, we conduct the
                  first comprehensive on-road emissions test of
                  light-duty vehicles with state-of-the-art Portable
                  Emission Measurement Systems. We find that nitrogen
                  oxides emissions of gasoline vehicles as well as
                  carbon monoxide and total hydrocarbon emissions of
                  both diesel and gasoline vehicles generally remain
                  below the respective emission limits. By contrast,
                  nitrogen oxides emissions of diesel vehicles (0.93
                  +/- 0.39 grams per kilometer {[}g/km]), including
                  modern Euro 5 diesel vehicles (0.62 +/- 0.19 g/km),
                  exceed emission limits by 320 +/- 90\%. On-road
                  carbon dioxide emissions surpass laboratory emission
                  levels by 21 +/- 9\%, suggesting that the current
                  laboratory emissions testing fails to accurately
                  capture the on-road. emissions of light-duty
                  vehicles. Our findings provide the empirical
                  foundation for the European Commission to establish
                  a complementary emissions test procedure for
                  light-duty vehicles. This procedure could be
                  implemented together with more stringent Euro 6
                  emission limits in 2014. The envisaged measures
                  should improve urban air quality and provide

                  industry.}},

  Abstract =	 {{Traffic-related emissions represent a major
                  component of airborne pollution. Historically,
                  dynamometer testing has been most widely used to
                  estimate vehicle emission rates, and these emission
                  rates, in turn, have been used as inputs when
                  modeling traffic-related air quality
                  impacts. However, such conventional drive cycle
                  testing is not considered strictly representative of
                  vehicles under real driving conditions. Therefore,
                  in recent years, significant scientific effort has
                  been focused on the measurement and analysis of
                  real-world vehicle emissions. Here, the use of
                  vehicle emissions monitoring methods (e.g., in-situ
                  methods such as tunnel, inverse dispersion, and
                  remote sensing studies, and in-traffic measures such
                  as probe vehicle and car chaser studies) to provide
                  real-world emission estimates is reviewed and
                  discussed in detail. Advantages and disadvantages
                  are identified for the different vehicle emissions
                  monitoring methods, both relative to
                  dynamometer-based approaches and each
                  other. Potential applications of different
                  approaches are also discussed, with particular
                  attention being placed on their complementary use.}},

                  quantile regression approach for the interpretation
                  of the nonlinear relationships between daily maximum
                  1-h ozone concentrations and both meteorological and
                  persistence information. When applied to eight years
                  (1992-1999) of data from four monitoring sites in
                  Athens, quantile regression results show that the
                  contributions of the explanatory variables to the
                  conditional distribution of the ozone concentrations
                  vary significantly at different ozone regimes. This
                  evidence of heterogeneity in the ozone values is
                  hidden in an ordinary least-square regression that
                  is confined to providing a single central tendency
                  measure. Furthermore, the utilization of an
                  `amalgated' quantile regression model leads to a
                  significantly improved goodness of fit at all
                  sites. Finally, computation of conditional ozone
                  densities through a simple quantile regression model
                  allows the estimation of complete density
                  distributions that can be used for forecasting next
                  day's ozone concentrations under an uncertainty

                  relationships between variables associated with

                  events. The odds ratio, widely used in medical
                  studies, can provide a powerful way of testing the
                  association between categorical forecasts and
                  observations. A skill score can be constructed from
                  the odds ratio that is less sensitive to hedging
                  than previously used scores. Furthermore,
                  significance tests can easily be performed on the
                  logarithm of the odds ratio to test whether the
                  skill is purely due to chance sampling. Functions of
                  the odds ratio and the Peirce skill score define a

                  requires only PM2.5 mass concentration and wind
                  direction data, and makes use of the EPA database on
                  PM(2.5) emissions in the local region of interest.
                  The method has been illustrated using data from the
                  Pittsburgh Air Quality Study, and suggests that
                  local sources can be very important in affecting

  Abstract =	 {{In order to better project the impacts of air
                  quality control measures, it is necessary to study
                  the behaviour of particulates beyond mass-based
                  metrics. To study the long term and seasonal trends
                  of particulate chemical composition in Manchester,
                  UK, seven Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) datasets
                  obtained from ambient sampling in central Manchester
                  over a seven year period have been combined and
                  compared. The size-resolved submicron nitrate,
                  sulphate, ammonium and organic matter data were
                  examined to assess the relative importance of
                  season, local meteorology and synoptic transport in
                  determining ambient concentrations. Systematic
                  trends were observed that were not previously
                  possible through the analysis of individual datasets
                  in isolation.  The results obtained here indicate
                  that prevailing westerly winds tend to bring
                  relatively consistent low levels of pollutants,
                  whereas Easterly and Northerly winds bring much more
                  variable pollutant concentrations, whose chemical
                  compositions are strongly dependent on
                  season. Specifically, continental air in the summer
                  brings with it high levels of sulphates whereas in
                  winter similar synoptic conditions and cold ground
                  temperatures tend to induce strong inversions,
                  trapping local pollution and leading to elevated
                  organic matter. Local temperature was also found to
                  be important, with the very low temperatures in
                  winter and very high temperatures in summer giving
                  the greatest concentrations of all components except
                  ammonium nitrate in summer, which began to evaporate
                  at the higher temperatures. These results will
                  assist in evaluating the chemical nature of air
                  pollution episodes and also provide a
                  phenomenological basis for testing chemical
                  transport and exposure models. While the results
                  focus on Manchester, similar phenomena could be
                  expected of a number of UK cities. (C) 2011 Elsevier

                  serious flaw. They routinely miss differences among
                  groups or associations among variables that are
                  detected by more modern techniques, even under very
                  small departures from normality. Hundreds of journal
                  articles have described the reasons standard
                  techniques can be unsatisfactory, but simple,
                  intuitive explanations are generally
                  unavailable. Situations arise where even highly
                  nonsignificant results become significant when
                  analyzed with more modern methods.Without assuming
                  the reader has any prior training in statistics,
                  Part I of this book describes basic statistical
                  principles from a point of view that makes their
                  shortcomings intuitive and easy to understand. The
                  emphasis is on verbal and graphical descriptions of
                  concepts. Part II describes modern methods that
                  address the problems covered in Part I. Using data
                  from actual studies, many examples are included to
                  illustrate the practical problems with conventional
                  procedures and how more modern methods can make a
                  substantial difference in the conclusions reached in

  Abstract =	 {{The three California cities of San Jose, Fresno,
                  and West Los Angeles (wLA) were visited during March
                  2008 to collect on-road emission measurements of
                  reactive nitrogen compounds from light-duty
                  vehicles, At the San Jose and wLA sites, comparison
                  with historical measurements showed that emissions
                  of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and
                  nitric oxide (NO) continue to decrease in the
                  on-road fleet, yet the ratio of nitrogen dioxide
                  (NO(2)) to NO in new diesel vehicles appears to be
                  undergoing large increases. A small fleet of 2007
                  diesel ambulances measured in Fresno was found to
                  have more than 60\% of their emitted oxides of
                  nitrogen as NO(2). Ammonia (NH(3)) emissions are
                  shown to have a strong dependence on model year and
                  vehicle specific power.  NH(3) means are 0.49 +/-
                  0.02, 0.49 +/- 0.01, and 0.79 +/- 0.02 g/kg of fuel
                  for San Jose, Fresno, and wLA, respectively, with
                  the larger emissions at the wLA site likely due to
                  driving mode. NH(3) at these locations was found to
                  account for 25\%, 22\%, and 27\% of the molar fixed
                  nitrogen emissions, respectively. Using these mean
                  values to construct a national fuel-based NH(3)
                  inventory results in a range of 210000 to 330000
                  short tons of NH(3) annually from light-duty
                  vehicles.}},

  Abstract =	 {{The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates
                  that federal air quality policies impose annual
                  costs in excess of \$80 billion (\$2010) with the
                  primary goal of improving human health. An area of
                  research, sometimes termed ``accountability,{''}
                  aims to quantify these benefits, and sometimes
                  costs, to understand the true impact of regulatory
                  actions. We review recent studies on accountability
                  and contrast their research designs. Key challenges
                  to accountability research are discussed and future
                  directions suggested. Most accountability studies
                  investigated short-term impacts at a local scale,
                  taking advantage of rapid changes in air quality due
                  to policy interventions, such as for the Olympic
                  Games. While useful, this research framework is not
                  applicable to more extensive regulatory actions that
                  deal with long-range transport, large spatial
                  scales, and longer timeframes. A growing number of
                  accountability studies investigate these issues,
                  although the development of additional methods is
                  needed. Challenges inherent to accountability
                  research are vast and include the choice of baseline
                  pollution and health response levels, transboundary
                  pollution from outside the study area, limitations
                  in exposure approaches (e.g., air quality modeling),
                  and extrapolation of epidemiological studies from
                  other populations or geographic areas. Findings from
                  accountability research can help decision-makers
                  design the most effective air quality policies, but
                  in many cases such studies are hindered by large
                  uncertainties. Given the challenges in
                  accountability research, extensive sensitivity
                  analyses and use of multiple methods would provide
                  more compelling evidence than the use of any single
                  approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  Abstract =	 {{A comprehensive `operational' evaluation of the
                  performance of the Community Multiscale Air Quality
                  (CMAQ) modelling system version 4.6 was conducted in
                  support of pollution assessment in the UK for the
                  calendar year 2003. The model was run on multiple
                  grids using one-way nests down to a horizontal
                  resolution as fine as 5 km over the whole of the
                  UK. The model performance was evaluated for
                  pollutants with standards and limit values
                  (e.g. O-3, PM10) and species contributing to acidic
                  and nitrogenous deposition (e.g. NH3, SO42-, NO3-,
                  NH4+) against data from operational national
                  monitoring networks. The key performance
                  characteristics of the modelling system were found
                  to be variable according to acceptance criteria and
                  to depend on the type (e.g. urban, rural) and
                  location of the sites, as well as on the time of the
                  year.  As regards the techniques that were used for
                  `operational' evaluation, performance generally
                  complied with expected levels and ranged from good
                  (e.g. O-3, SO42- to moderate (e.g. PM10, NO3-). At a
                  few sites low correlations and large standard
                  deviations for some species (e.g. SO2) suggest that
                  these sites are subject to local factors
                  (e.g. topography, emission sources) that are not
                  well described in the model. Overall, the model
                  tends to over predict O-3 and under predict aerosol
                  species (except SO42-). Discrepancies between
                  predicted and observed concentrations may be due to
                  a variety of intertwined factors, which include
                  inaccuracies in meteorological predictions, chemical
                  boundary conditions, temporal variability in
                  emissions, and uncertainties in the treatment of gas
                  and aerosol chemistry. Further work is thus required
                  to investigate the respective contributions of such
                  factors on the predicted concentrations. (C) 2010

                  have dropped between 48\% (West LA) and 68\%
                  (Chicago). Three observed factors common to all of
                  the sites are that the emission reductions are
                  occurring in vehicles of all ages, that the
                  influence of engine load on fuel-specific emissions,
                  especially for CO and NO, is reduced and that
                  fleet-averaged emission deterioration is near zero
                  for model years newer than 2001 and older than
                  1990. These nationwide data sets imply that the
                  majority of these on-road emissions reductions are
                  the result of continued improvements in function and
                  durability of vehicle emission control systems and
                  that inspection and maintenance and fuel
                  reformulation programs have only played a minor

                  emission measurements and future emission standards
                  into the emission model `NEMO' (Network Emission
                  Model). This model is then applied to make
                  predictions on vehicle emission levels on basis of
                  the Austrian fleet composition until 2020. The
                  output is compared to the results based on the most
                  common emission tool for the calculation of vehicle
                  emissions in Central Europe the recent version (2.1)
                  of the `Handbook Emission Factors for Road
                  Transport'. The discussion is focused on NOx and
                  particulate matter (PM), since these pollutants are
                  considered to be the most critical for the local air
                  quality level. The NOx emission levels of recent
                  modern diesel vehicle generations observed in
                  several real world driving conditions were observed
                  to be clearly higher than demanded in the type
                  approval procedure. Due to the growing number of
                  modern diesel engine concepts equipped with coated
                  catalytic exhaust after treatment, the fraction of
                  NO2 of the total tailpipe NOx emissions is predicted
                  to continue to increase in the next few
                  years. Bearing in mind the upcoming tightening of
                  the NO2 air quality limits and the steady increase
                  of traffic volumes, excesses of the NO2 air quality
                  limits at roadside locations have to be expected to
                  an increasing extent for the beginning of the next
                  decade. The issue of particle emissions originated
                  from the diesel engine combustion process can be
                  regarded as being technically solved due to the
                  extensive introduction of diesel particle filters in
                  the vehicle fleet if these systems will prove a high
                  efficiency over the entire vehicle life in real
                  world operation conditions. However, PM emissions
                  from road transport will continue to be in the focus
                  of public attention due to particle emissions caused
                  by dust re-suspension and abrasion processes.  (C)

                  making inferences and forecasts in the face of
                  uncertainty. It should not be surprising, therefore,
                  that statistical methods have a key role to play in

  Abstract =	 {{This paper discusses the need for critically
                  evaluating regional-scale (similar to 200-2,000 km)
                  three-dimensional numerical photochemical air
                  quality modeling systems to establish a model's
                  credibility in simulating the spatio-temporal
                  features embedded in the observations.  Because of
                  limitations of currently used approaches for
                  evaluating regional air quality models, a framework
                  for model evaluation is introduced here for
                  determining the suitability of a modeling system for
                  a given application, distinguishing the performance
                  between different models through confidence-testing
                  of model results, guiding model development and
                  analyzing the impacts of regulatory policy
                  options. The framework identifies operational,
                  diagnostic, dynamic, and probabilistic types of
                  model evaluation. Operational evaluation techniques
                  include statistical and graphical analyses aimed at
                  determining whether model estimates are in agreement
                  with the observations in an overall
                  sense. Diagnostic evaluation focuses on
                  process-oriented analyses to determine whether the
                  individual processes and components of the model
                  system are working correctly, both independently and
                  in combination. Dynamic evaluation assesses the
                  ability of the air quality model to simulate changes
                  in air quality stemming from changes in source
                  emissions and/or meteorology, the principal forces
                  that drive the air quality model. Probabilistic
                  evaluation attempts to assess the confidence that
                  can be placed in model predictions using techniques
                  such as ensemble modeling and Bayesian model
                  averaging. The advantages of these types of model
                  evaluation approaches are discussed in this paper.}},

  Abstract =	 {{For at least 30 years, ozone (O-3) levels on
                  weekends in parts of California's South Coast (Los
                  Angeles) Air Basin (SoCAB) have been as high as or
                  higher than on weekdays, even though ambient levels
                  of O-3 precursors are lower on weekends than on
                  weekdays. A field study was conducted in the Los
                  Angeles area during fall 2000 to test whether
                  proposed relationships between emission sources and
                  ambient nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) and oxides of
                  nitrogen (NOx) levels can account for observed
                  diurnal and day-of-week variations in the
                  concentration and proportions of precursor
                  pollutants that may affect the efficiency and rate
                  of O-3 formation. The contributions to ambient NMHC
                  by motor vehicle exhaust and evaporative emissions,
                  estimated using chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor
                  modeling, ranged from 65 to 85\% with minimal
                  day-of-week variation. Ratios of ambient NOx
                  associated with black carbon (BC) to NOx associated
                  with carbon monoxide (CO) were approximately 1.25
                  +/- 0.22 during weekdays and 0.76 +/- 0.07 and 0.52
                  +/- 0.07 on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. These
                  results demonstrate that lower NOx emissions from
                  diesel exhaust can be a major factor causing lower
                  NOx mixing ratios and higher NMHC/NOx ratios on
                  weekends. Nonmobile sources showed no significant
                  day-of-week variations in their contributions to
                  NMHC. Greater amounts of gasoline emissions are
                  carried over on Friday and Saturday evenings but
                  are, at most, a minor factor contributing to higher
                  NMHC/NOx ratios on weekend mornings.}},

                  validation of the reactive organic gas and carbon
                  monoxide emission inventories for California's South
                  Coast Air Basin by comparing speciation profiles for
                  nonmethane organic gases (NMOG) and ratios of
                  CO/NO(x) and NMOG/NO(x) derived from early-morning
                  (0700 to 0800) ambient measurements taken during the
                  1987 Southern California Air Quality Study with the
                  corresponding ratios and speciation profiles derived
                  from day-specific, hourly gridded emission
                  inventories.  We considered twenty separate
                  comparisons for each ratio, each representing a
                  different combination of season, emission category,
                  and spatial and temporal averaging of emissions.  We
                  determined that the most appropriate comparison in
                  summer was ambient pollutant ratios with ratios
                  derived from morning on-road motor vehicle emission
                  inventories, and in the fall, ambient ratios with
                  ratios derived from overnight on-road motor vehicle
                  emission inventories with some contribution from
                  overnight stationary-source NO(x) emission
                  inventories.  From these comparisons, the ambient
                  CO/NO(x) and NMOG/NO(x) ratios are about 1.5 and 2
                  to 2.5 times higher, respectively, than the
                  corresponding inventory ratios.  On the assumption
                  that inventories of NO(x) emissions are reasonably
                  correct, these results indicate that on-road motor
                  vehicle CO and NMOG emissions are significantly
                  underestimated.  Our comparisons of measured CO,
                  NMOG, and NO(x) concentrations and CO/NO(x) and
                  NMOG/NO(x) ratios with air quality model predictions
                  obtained by the California Air Resources Board show

                  TiO2-containing material is left outdoors as a form
                  of flat panels, it is activated by sunlight to
                  remove harmful NOx gases during the day. The
                  photocatalytic efficiency of a TiO2-treated mortar
                  for removal of NOx was investigated in the frame of
                  this work.  For this purpose a fully equipped
                  monitoring system was designed at a pilot site. This
                  system allows the in situ evaluation of the
                  de-polluting properties of a photocatalytic material
                  by taking into account the climatologic phenomena in
                  street canyons, accurate measurements of pollution
                  level and full registration of meteorological data
                  The pilot site involved three artificial canyon
                  streets, a pollution source, continuous NOx
                  measurements inside the canyons and the source as
                  well as background and meteorological
                  measurements. Significant differences on the NOx
                  concentration level were observed between the TiO2
                  treated and the reference canyon. NOx values in TiO2
                  canyon were 36.7 to 82.0\% lower than the ones
                  observed in the reference one. Data arising from

                  NO2 to NOx emissions from the road transport sector
                  in Europe are well documented in the literature. A
                  photochemical trajectory model has been used to
                  simulate the impact of increasing the NO2 fraction
                  on the chemical evolution of air masses arriving at
                  the TORCH field campaign site in the southern UK
                  during late July and August 2003, a period which
                  included a widespread photochemical pollution
                  episode associated with a heat-wave. The impact of
                  partial emissions of NOx in the form of nitrous acid
                  (HONO) has also been considered. The model
                  incorporates emissions of NOx, CO, SO2, Methane and
                  a detailed speciation of non-methane volatile
                  organic compounds (VOC), coupled with a
                  comprehensive description of the chemistry of
                  secondary pollutant formation. An increase in the
                  fractional contribution of NO2 to NOx emissions from
                  0\% to 30\% (v/v) results in a 2.49 ppb increase in
                  the simulated campaign mean mixing ratio of oxidant
                  (defined as the SUM Of O-3 and NO2). This is almost
                  exclusively in the form Of O-3, and represents a
                  ca. 7\% increase in the simulated campaign mean O-3
                  mixing ratio. Consideration of 156 events, at
                  6-hourly resolution throughout the campaign period,
                  indicates that oxidant increments during the
                  heat-wave period are generally simulated to be
                  greater than those for the remainder of the
                  campaign, with a Maximum increment of ca. 12
                  ppb. The increases in oxidant mixing ratios are
                  shown to derive from both the direct effect of
                  increased NO2 input, and indirectly from the
                  enhanced regional-scale chemical processing that
                  this promotes. An illustrative increase in the
                  fractional contribution of HONO to NOx emissions
                  from 0\% to 5\% (v/v) results in increases in the
                  simulated campaign mean mixing ratios Of O-3 and
                  oxidant of 1.51 and 1.15 ppb, respectively, with the
                  smaller increment for oxidant reflecting a decrease
                  in the NO2 mixing ratio resulting from a notably
                  enhanced NOx oxidation rate. The oxidant increments
                  during the heat-wave period are once again simulated
                  to be greater than those for the remainder of the
                  campaign, with a maximum increment of ca. 11 ppb,
                  which results exclusively from the enhanced
                  regional-scale chemical processing that the HONO
                  emissions promote. The impact of increased
                  fractional NO2 and HONO emissions on the rate of
                  oxidation of NOx to nitrate is also illustrated and
                  discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

                  to the surface of commercially available
                  self-cleaning window glass has been studied under
                  controlled laboratory conditions. This material is
                  one of an array of modem building products which
                  incorporate titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles
                  and are finding increasing use in populated urban
                  areas. Amongst the principal drivers for the use of
                  these materials is that they are thought to
                  facilitate the irreversible removal of pollutants
                  such as NO2 and organic molecules from the
                  atmosphere and thus act to remediate air
                  quality. While it appears that TiO2 materials do
                  indeed remove organic molecules from built
                  environments, in this study we show that the
                  photoenhanced uptake of NO2 to one example material,
                  self-cleaning window glass, is in fact accompanied
                  by the substantial formation (50-70\%) of gaseous
                  nitrous acid (HONO).  This finding has direct and
                  serious implications for the use of these materials
                  in urban areas. Not only is HONO a harmful
                  respiratory irritant, it is also readily photolysed
                  by solar radiation leading to the formation of
                  hydroxyl radicals (OH) together with the re-release
                  of NO, as NO. The net effect of subsequent OH
                  initiated chemistry can then be the further
                  degradation of air quality through the formation of
                  secondary pollutants such as ozone and VOC oxidation
                  products.  In summary, we suggest that a
                  scientifically conceived technical strategy for air
                  quality remediation based on this technology, while
                  widely perceived as universally beneficial, could in
                  fact have effects precisely opposite to those
                  intended. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  Abstract =	 {{The UK External Vehicle Speed Control (EVSC)
                  project has made a prediction of the accident
                  savings with intelligent speed adaptation (ISA), and
                  estimated the costs and benefits of national
                  implementation.  The best prediction of accident
                  reduction was that the fitting on all vehicles of a
                  simple mandatory system, with which it would be
                  impossible for vehicles to exceed the speed limit,
                  would save 20\% of injury accidents and 37\% of
                  fatal accidents. A more complex version of the
                  mandatory system, including a capability to respond
                  to current network and weather conditions, would
                  result in a reduction of 36\% in injury accidents
                  and 59\% in fatal accidents. The implementation path
                  recommended by the project would lead to compulsory
                  usage in 2019. The cost-benefit analysis carried out
                  showed that the benefit-cost ratios for this
                  implementation strategy were in a range from 7.9 to
                  15.4, i.e.  the payback for the system could be up
                  to 15 times the cost of implementing and running
                  it. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

                  sum (CUSUM) analysis. Within the charging zone (CZ),
                  the Wilcoxon test has shown that the difference in
                  speed between pre- and post-CCS periods has
                  increased on average by 2.1 km h-1 and that these
                  changes are significant at the p=0.05 level. The
                  CUSUM analysis has provided evidence of the timing
                  of this change in mean speed in the CZ and this
                  agrees well with the introduction of the CCS on the
                  17 February 2003. In combination, these results
                  provide compelling evidence that the introduction of
                  congestion charging has significantly increased
                  vehicle speed in the CZ and by comparison with the
                  results in inner London, that these changes are not
                  part of a wider trend. To examine one impact of this
                  change we used an instantaneous emissions model, the
                  Vehicle Transient Emissions Simulation Software, to
                  undertake a comparison between the change in vehicle
                  emissions associated with changing driving
                  characteristics, between pre- and post-charging
                  periods, and those associated with a change in
                  average speed. The analysis was limited to three
                  vehicle types: a Euro II LGV, a Euro III diesel car
                  and a Euro IV petrol car, but showed that driving
                  characteristics in central London have a relatively
                  small effect on emissions of NOX and CO2 compared
                  with the average vehicle speed. However, for PM10
                  emissions from the Euro II LGV the opposite was
                  found and for this vehicle the driving
                  characteristics were more important than the average
                  speed in estimating exhaust emissions. For this
                  vehicle, emissions increased between pre- and
                  post-CCS periods by 4%. For the Euro IV petrol car
                  NOX emissions also increased by 6% between pre- and
                  post-CCS periods. These findings will help to
                  further understand the extent to which congestion
                  charging reduces vehicle emissions in London.},

                  mode of presentation is via code examples with
                  liberal commenting of the code and the output, from
                  the computational as well as the statistical
                  viewpoint. A supplementary R package can be
                  downloaded and contains the data sets.  The
                  statistical methodology includes statistical
                  standard distributions, one- and two-sample tests
                  with continuous data, regression analysis, one- and

  abstract =	 {Road-transport emissions were projected to 2020
                  using the TREMOVE model to estimate the vehicle
                  stock mix over EU15 and three new European member
                  states (Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland). The
                  COPERT model was used to estimate the exhaust
                  emissions of NOx, NO2 and PM2.5.  Non-exhaust (tyre
                  and break wear) PM2.5 and PM10 were also calculated.
                  Emissions were projected following current
                  legislation (CLE) measures and a scenario
                  representing maximum feasible technical reductions
                  (MFR). Projections to 2020 showed that CLE will
                  bring 89, 25 and 50% reductions in NOx from gasoline
                  passenger cars (GPCs), diesel passenger cars (DPCs)
                  and heavy duty vehicles (HDVs), respectively, over
                  2000 levels, when comparing average emissions on a
                  per vehicle-km basis. The corresponding reductions
                  in the MFR scenario were 91, 53 and 67%,
                  respectively. Despite these significant reductions,
                  NO2 emissions do not seem to be effectively
                  controlled for DPCs due to the increased NO2/NOx,
                  ratio of new and expected aftertreatment systems.
                  Moreover, there is an almost 9-fold increase of NO2
                  emissions from mopeds, as they gradually shift to
                  stoichiometric mixtures, four-stroke combustion and
                  use of catalysts in the exhaust. Following CLE, PM
                  exhaust and non-exhaust emissions will decrease on a
                  per vehicle-km basis by 61% for DPCs and 63% for
                  HDVs. Reductions by MFR over the reference year are
                  estimated in the order of 77% and 65% for DPCs and
                  HDVs, respectively. However, the increasing share of
                  non-exhaust sources to the total PM emissions may
                  hamper the effectiveness of exhaust control measures
                  in meeting future urban air-quality standards.  (C)

                  control and manage air pollution, principally but
                  not exclusively focussing upon the challenge of
                  managing air pollution in urban environments. The
                  development and implementation of a range of air
                  pollution control measures are considered. Initially
                  the measures implemented primarily addressed point
                  sources, a small number of fuel types and a limited
                  number of pollutants. The adequacy of such a
                  source-control approach is assessed within the
                  context of a changing and challenging air pollution
                  climate. An assessment of air quality management in
                  the United Kingdom over a 50-year timeframe
                  exemplifies the range of issues and challenges in
                  contemporary air quality management. The need for
                  new approaches is explored and the development and
                  implementation of an effects-based, risk management
                  system for air quality regulation is evaluated. (C)

  Abstract =	 {{{[}1] Accurate emission inventories and their
                  temporal trends must be incorporated into pollutant
                  inventories to allow for reliable modeling of the
                  country's past, present, and future air
                  quality. Measured carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen
                  oxide (NOx) concentrations from two urban areas show
                  that the CO/NOx vehicular emission ratio has
                  decreased at an average rate of 7-9\% per year from
                  1987 to 1999. This amounts to a factor of nearly 3
                  over the 12 years. The current U. S. Environmental
                  Protection Agency tabulations of estimated pollutant
                  emission trends indicate a rate of decrease smaller
                  by a factor of 2-3. The trend in maximum ambient CO
                  levels in U. S. cities suggests a 5.2 +/- 0.8\% per
                  year average annual decrease in CO vehicular
                  emissions, which implies a 2-3\% annual increase in
                  NOx emissions from vehicles. Thus over the decade of
                  the 1990s, annual U. S. CO emissions from vehicles
                  have decreased from similar to65 to similar to38 Tg,
                  representing approximate decreases of 6 and 3\% in
                  the annual global fuel-use CO emissions and in total
                  global anthropogenic CO emissions, respectively.  It
                  is expected that the volatile organic compound
                  (VOC)/NOx vehicular exhaust emission ratio has
                  decreased similarly, implying that the character of
                  atmospheric photochemistry in U. S. urban areas has
                  changed significantly over the decade.}},

                  gasoline light-duty vehicle (LDV) emissions - CO,
                  HC, NO - were conducted on a freeway ramp in
                  Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1991, 1995 and 1998. Based on
                  almost 30,000 emission measurements, the results
                  show that both catalyst cars and non-catalyst cars
                  emissions deteriorate over time, but also that the
                  emission performance of new TWC-cars has improved
                  significantly in recent years. Furthermore, it was
                  found that fleet age rather than model year
                  determines the rate of emission deterioration for
                  TWC-cars for both CO and NO. The study demonstrates
                  that remote sensing may constitute a powerful tool
                  to evaluate real-world LDV emissions; however, daily
                  held calibration procedures need to be developed in
                  order to assure that the evolution in fleet average
                  emissions can be accurately measured. (C) 2000

  abstract =	 {Measurements of ozone and other trace species in the
                  European EMEP network in 2003 are presented. The
                  European summer of 2003 was exceptionally warm, and
                  the surface ozone data for central Europe show the
                  highest values since the end of the 1980s. The 95th
                  percentiles of daily maximum hourly ozone
                  concentrations in 2003 were higher than the
                  corresponding parameter measured in any previous
                  year at many sites in France, Germany, Switzerland
                  and Austria. In this paper we argue that a number of
                  positive feedbacks between the weather conditions
                  and ozone contributed to the elevated surface
                  ozone. First, we calculated an extended residence
                  time of air parcels in the atmospheric boundary
                  layer for several sites in central Europe. Second,
                  we show that it is likely that extensive forest
                  fires on the Iberian Peninsula, resulting from the
                  drought and heat, contributed to the peak ozone
                  values in north Europe in August. Third,
                  regional-scale model calculations indicate that
                  enhanced levels of biogenic isoprene could have
                  contributed up to 20% of the peak ozone
                  concentrations. Measurements indicate elevated
                  concentrations of isoprene compared to previous
                  years. Sensitivity runs with a global chemical
                  transport model showed that a reduction in the
                  surface dry deposition due to drought and the
                  elevated air temperature both could have contributed
                  significantly to the enhanced ozone
                  concentrations. Because of climate change, such heat
                  waves may occur more frequently in the future and
                  may gradually overshadow the effect of reduced
                  emissions from anthropogenic sources of VOC and NOx
                  in controlling surface ozone.},
